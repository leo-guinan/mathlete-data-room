@wvuncensored @Myhellokitten Kids these days do not. They face a broken economy that continues to get worse. The world tells them to follow unsustainable paths in order to be "successful". Some things are easier, yes. But I do not envy those reaching adulthood over the past few years. It's shitty now.
