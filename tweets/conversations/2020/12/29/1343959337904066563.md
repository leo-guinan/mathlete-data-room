@JuliaKuemper @BartCentiPenny @AshleySLiu Possibly. I am still working out the details. I am trying to make it possible for anyone to invest in anyone/anything easily. So every person or idea creates a crypto that they can easily distribute. Investors give it a base price and the value grows over time via speculation.
