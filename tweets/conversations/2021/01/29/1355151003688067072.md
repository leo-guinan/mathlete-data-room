@_noliability @riotgames @opensea For me, decentralization is a goal. That is a reasonable use of Facebook. I even agree that many times it is the best for the exact things you mentioned. But it won't be forever. Where are those communities going to end up? Decentralized. Those communities don't need facebook.
