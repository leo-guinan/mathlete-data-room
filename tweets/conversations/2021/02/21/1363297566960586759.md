@dunkhippo33 @ericbahn @HustleFundVC Kinda. I do have subscriptions set up on the site for the content portion. The actual SaaS part is what I am launching next. I had been testing some ideas with users before I started to build but now that I have gotten some good feedback I am working to get it live ASAP
