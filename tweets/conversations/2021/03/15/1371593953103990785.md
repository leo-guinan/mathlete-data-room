@jessejanderson @ADHDdesigner @AdultingADHD Yeah, I definitely discovered that I relied on more of it than I thought. But now I get to build my own structure. It is nice to have full control over it so I don't have to rely on a company for it. At least I left on my own terms and it didn't blindside me.
