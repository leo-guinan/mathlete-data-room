@RaaaandomShiiit @AskADHD That's good advice. My issue with that in the past was that they usually focus on weaknesses instead of strengths. Granted, I didn't know I was ADHD/ASD for most of them, which explains some weird reactions I felt in the aftermath. I really like the focus on strengths part.
