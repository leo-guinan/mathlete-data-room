@jowyang @bretkinsella @chrismessina Fully agree. I love that idea. Definitely inline with my long term vision. I think there is still too much of a focus on individual creators. It really takes teams to be successful but that's not what platforms are setup to reward. And yep, micropayments are a piece.
