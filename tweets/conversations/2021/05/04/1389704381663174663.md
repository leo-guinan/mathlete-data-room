@CumLaudeEscort @AdultingADHD Good luck. It can be tough. The one thing I focus on for motivation is turning my life into a story. I think about the desired outcome and figure out how the task I need to complete is the next page of the story. It ties it to a goal/game and makes it more interesting for me.
