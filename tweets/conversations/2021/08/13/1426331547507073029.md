@Goodluckraph @TrungTPhan @jspujji Ultimately, it came down to the fact that I realized my cofounder and I weren't a good fit. And I was trying to do way too much, which was wrecking my mental health. Combine all of that with no income, and I realized I needed to do something different.

But I learned so much.
