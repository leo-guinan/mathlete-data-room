@roqueadeleon @thisiskp_ @ProductHunt Yep. Most people don't care how the sausage is made. They just want to eat the sausage.

The problem with technical people (and I am very much guilty of this) is that we tend to be really interested in how we make the sausage. So we want to talk about the details.
