@rroudt @jessejanderson @p_millerd @feathercrm They are, and that's one of the things stopping me from just implementing them. I want to make sure I handle the privacy right.

They do seem to be available via the API. One of the things I'm looking at is potentially making it easy to route DMs to your storage medium of choice.
