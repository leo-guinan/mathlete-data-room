@coreyhainesco @NotechAna @SwipeFilesco I've done a good bit with convertkit and, while I haven't done much with memberstack yet, I'm looking at potentially building an integration between memberstack and my SaaS platform at some point, so that chat would be useful for me there too.

Just let me know! üëç
