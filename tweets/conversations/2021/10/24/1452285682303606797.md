@dovewayonwuka @NotechAna I didn't find a cofounder that I aligned with.

Our communication styles/needs were different. 

Our visions of what we wanted the world to be were different.

Our levels of risk were different.

Having a cofounder ended up feeling like it was making things harder, not easier
