@Hahaitsfunny @SHL0MS @Grady_Booch They do. The trustless part comes in at the immutable part though. Once it's been recorded on chain, trust is no longer needed.

Actually, this makes me think a bit. The more trust accrued over time, the more trust grantable instantly. 

That's an interesting model.
