@ADHDdesigner Really sorry to hear that. 

Something that helps me: I've been working on being ok with being burnt out. I'm trying to focus on self compassion. 

It's OK to need breaks. It's OK to bump deadlines. Take some time to recover, otherwise it's just going to come back worse. https://t.co/vle7n7nvZ6
