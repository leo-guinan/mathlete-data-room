@NotechAna @arvidkahl @robertodigital_ @dagorenouf @CicmilJovan @AlessandraEsse Actually makes me realize something about how I used to use Twitter. I collected followers like little tokens. I didn't say a lot, so followers didn't really make sense to me.

I'm still figuring out this whole "people care what I have to say" thing.
