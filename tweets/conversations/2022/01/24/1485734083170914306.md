@sashayoung72 @ADHDJobs @LobowSpark @GeraintWorks @MindsetByDave @TheKookamonga @BlushingCrafter @ADHDdesigner I think this has a lot to do with our taught reliance on "experts" to tell us things about ourselves, when we are really the experts on ourselves.

There's irony in the issue going the other way, where people decide they are experts on a topic because they read an article once.
