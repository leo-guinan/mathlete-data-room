@jumpshipdev @dagorenouf @KilianPoulinTW So in my case, I'm building out a SaaS. So I try to connect with people who have one running and those who are starting to build one or want to build one. 

Once you find a couple of people to connect with, you can see who they are connected with, and slowly expand your network.
