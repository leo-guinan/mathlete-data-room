@markyerkes1734 @feathercrm Like mobile app? Probably pretty long. I've developed exactly 1 mobile app, and it was back in college as part of a practicum.

I've played around with app dev a little, but it would probably require the webapp taking off a bit and allowing me to hire people to build it.
