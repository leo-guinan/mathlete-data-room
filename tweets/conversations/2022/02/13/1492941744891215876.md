@StroutMotivateU Was really interesting. 

The high fructose corn syrup seemed to bond to the caffeine in the extraction process so I wasn't able to extract pure caffeine from it.

Ended up being black gooey stuff instead of white powder. 

Really fun time though. 

Now I might need a Chem lab.ðŸ¤”
