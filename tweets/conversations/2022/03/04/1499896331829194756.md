@LobowSpark @3L_strugglebus @GeraintWorks @ADHDdesigner @JustinAllingham @tshubillabong @BlushingCrafter @MindsetByDave So great news and not so great news.

The great news is that the bromance delivered. This is going to be incredible. I can't wait to share it.

the not so great news? I now have almost 2 hours to go edit. I'm gonna need to upgrade my Descript for this. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Worth it.
