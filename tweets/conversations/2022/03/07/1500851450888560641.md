@jonathanhillis5 @justingordon212 @hellostartupla @_KelseyHahn @hdubugras @FounderEric @jacksads @agazdecki Yeah, you're going to laugh, but I don't have a routine. As soon as I do, it's ruined, and that throws me off.

For me, the key is flexibility. I usually wake up around 6 and will write for a bit before helping the kids off to school. then 730-9 are for my side projects
