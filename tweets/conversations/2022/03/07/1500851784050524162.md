@jonathanhillis5 @justingordon212 @hellostartupla @_KelseyHahn @hdubugras @FounderEric @jacksads @agazdecki 9-6ish are for my day job, 6-8 is time with the kids, and 8-10 is tv and/or side project work

From there, I try to prioritize the most I can do in the time available that day. I try to break things down into chunks I can accomplish.
