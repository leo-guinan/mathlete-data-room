@davidnunez I spent a long time staring at the camera without knowing what to say.

I've found the trick that helps me is to start thinking out loud. "I'd like to talk about &lt;topic&gt;, so what should I say? Maybe I can start off by talking about &lt;sub point 1&gt;"

Just start saying anything.
