@evan_just_evan @shelbyspees @jennplusplus @MissAmyTobey @ReinH I actually love this. I've talked before about "skill inflation", which requires people to learn more and more to stay at the same level.

This is why it ends up being more lucrative to leave companies. You learn more then you get paid for.

So I think you're on the same page.
