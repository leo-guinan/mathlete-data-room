@NotechAna @markyerkes1734 @ioannhe @ArlanWasHere @MyBuddyAndrew @lyssquire @xTiffVicious Agree on the effort part Ana!

We tend to attract what we put out.

And the stuff we put out is based on who we tend to interact with and who we follow.

So to find positive and helpful people, put out positive and helpful content. creates a powerful flywheel.
