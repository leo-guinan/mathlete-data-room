@fortelabs @Bazzaruto @Nicolascole77 I don't think I've ever seen an ad for any of their courses/communities. They don't need to. I've seen how they've changed lives. I've had them recommended to me by all sorts of people.

When I'm talking about Impact Marketing, that's the type of thing I'm talking about.
