@NotechAna @fortelabs @Bazzaruto @Nicolascole77 @dagorenouf @StroutMotivateU @bkh_leung @hellostartupla Thanks Ana! 

One of the main problems I see is that trends can be misleading. That's something I've run into a lot as I try to untangle which trends are the most important.

Once I filtered the noise, I was able to see which trends were the most impactful and focus on those.
