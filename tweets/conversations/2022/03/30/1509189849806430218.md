@cjaythecreator @dagorenouf @codebeef_ I like failing. It tells me I don't understand something so there's an opportunity to learn.

If you want to learn, failing is the fastest way. Jump in, try, fail, and then assess.

Fail as much as you can early to learn as much as possible early. Failure costs more later.
