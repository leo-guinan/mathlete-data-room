@StroutMotivateU @Jeremy_J_Jacob Yep. That's why one of my goals is to help people understand 2 parts:
1. The problems are fixable
2. Every single person has the ability to contribute to the solutions.

If we start from there and go forward, we'll be OK I think. Those people won't have power with just money.
