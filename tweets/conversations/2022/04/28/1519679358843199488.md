@oluadedej @ncb000gt @Stinaia There's always something to be done right?

It is so hard to turn off. 

There needs to be some sort of balance, but it can be hard to find. 

Makes it even harder when the people around you don't get it. 

It was refreshing to find a community of founders here because of that.
