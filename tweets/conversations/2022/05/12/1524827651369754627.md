@PeterKSimeonov @StroutMotivateU Love this so much! My 10 year old was with my dad a few months ago and they had a great discussion on US history. My Dad was astonished by his knowledge. But he got a series of books he loved and read through them all.

Letting kids explore the things they care about is so key!
