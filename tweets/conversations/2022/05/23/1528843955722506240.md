@eggs_mayhem @timberners_lee @LobowSpark That's the most common reason that people tend to be shitty on social media: we're all fighting for attention. 

It's like kids who act out because that's when their parents pay attention to them.

Similar dynamics at play.

So we need to not reward bad behavior with views.
