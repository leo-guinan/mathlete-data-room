@SeaCatWiz @yagudaev @mauro_codes @robertodigital_ @bkh_leung I think we can achieve a level of cooperative effort that will help us achieve our goals with a fraction of the effort/resources we are all pouring in individually.

Let me know if you'd be interested in chatting through it a bit. Would love your input on the ideas.
