@DanSchoonmaker @tdinh_me @blackmagic_so Haha, right? It's so tough to catch everything.  I've been playing around with a bunch of ideas related to content discovery and relationship maintenance. Twitter is too focused with numbers always going up and not quality.

So hopefully I'll have some cool new things coming soon
