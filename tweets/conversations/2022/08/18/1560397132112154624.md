@StroutMotivateU @friend_content It's nothing specific. It's really more about tagging, so anything you would want to link as a blog would work. I have plans to enhance it by scanning the links in the future and possibly RSS feeds or some other mechanisms.

And yeah LI is on my list to check out but not yet.
