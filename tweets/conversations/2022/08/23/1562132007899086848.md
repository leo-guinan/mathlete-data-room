@gjsequeira Haha, thanks! 

Will say, GPT-3 is really good at what it does. I'm actually surprised it went away from the pattern I provided (I focused on 98% of &lt;whoever&gt; do &lt;something&gt; style examples, so was thinking it would give more of those). But it did so in a really powerful way. https://t.co/MWosf5szj6
