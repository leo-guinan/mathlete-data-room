@StroutMotivateU @eggs_mayhem More and more, I'm a believer that these types of large AI models will completely change a lot of things in a relatively short time frame.

The speed at which they are developing is completely unrivaled.

The question is more about how fast laws adapt. (not optimistic about that)
