@NafetsWirth @benjamingreeley @feathercrm Should clarify, that's what happens when platforms optimize for number of interactions over quality.

There are ways to do it effectively as an end user, but it would be more helpful if platforms gave you tools to evaluate and prioritize based on quality.

That's what I'm adding.
