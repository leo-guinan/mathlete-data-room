@bittu_singh95 @benjamingreeley There are, but the reality of building for the future is that there is a lot of unknown. And there are more possibilities than ever before.

Reading startup books will tell you what happened in the past that worked.

Reading SciFi will help you imagine the future.

That's harder.
