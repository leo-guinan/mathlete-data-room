@randomshenans @should_unfollow Hmm, that's not good. Does take a little bit to do the initial analysis, but it should have a couple accounts showing at least.

Have you tried refreshing?

I'm implementing notifications that will alert you when it's done in case things back up too
 
That should be up today.
