@LeeEnglestone @should_unfollow Unfortunately it does. I tried using the newer Oauth 2 implementation but it was too buggy. The token refresh wasn't reliable,  so I switched back to oauth1.1, which has read, read/write, and read/write/DM permissions. 

It's set at read/write which is the lowest for it to work.
