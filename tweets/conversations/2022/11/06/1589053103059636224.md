@JordanHarbinger @profgalloway 100%. You have to have enough knowledge to find the experts that are actually experts, vs the ones who are good at marketing and therefore discoverable.

The irony is that if you spend time on the skills, you become a better expert but not as discoverable.

need both skills now
