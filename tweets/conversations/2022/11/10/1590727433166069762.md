@austinwithay @randomshenans I think this can depend, honestly. It works well for certain audiences. But it's tough to spend a bunch of time on when it tends to have a short-lived lifespan.

Whereas blogs tend to have longer lifespans, so there's a certain tradeoff you have to think about, or just do both.
