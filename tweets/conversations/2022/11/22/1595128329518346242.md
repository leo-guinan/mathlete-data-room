@patricegorissen @StroutMotivateU Part of it was that I have 2 groups of kids usually. There are a couple that are more wild/outgoing and a couple that are more the shy, quiet, reserved types.

The second group wasn't there this time and it was just the first.

The balance was thrown way off and I wasn't ready.
