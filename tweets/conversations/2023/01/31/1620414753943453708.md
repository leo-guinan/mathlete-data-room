@thebrianto @austinschless @grahamkmann Oh wow, I love that idea. I'm thinking about riffing on something similar. 

I'm seeing quite a few people who are interested, but have all sorts of reasons to not start.

I've always found that starting is the hardest part. If you help them overcome that, cool things happen.
