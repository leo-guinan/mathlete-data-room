@jillathrilla @tinyrevver @DescriptApp 100% agree.

@DescriptApp makes life way easier. I'm also a believer that production quality isn't as important as a lot of people make it out to be. Especially starting out, because it's more about learning and discovery. Production value increases along the way.
