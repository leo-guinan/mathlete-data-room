@RamliJohn @arvidkahl @JustinAllingham Absolutely! I think about it a lot. I've got an 11-year-old and an 8-year-old and the school system drives me nuts on a pretty regular basis. ðŸ˜…

But it's so cool to watch them figure out who they are and what they love doing.

Support those interests and magic happens. ðŸ˜€
