@StroutMotivateU @DirtyDataGirl That's a good question.

I definitely am in the "don't care nearly as much about specifics" camp. 

But without prodding, I probably wouldn't get much set up on my own. I tend to get focused on my own world of things and kinda forget the outside social world quite a bit.
