@darentsmith @CSMikeCardona It totally is, but that's intentional - I'm essentially investing in a number of users I can work closely with as the app evolves. I'm going to limit that group to somewhere around 10 or 20.

Plus lets me offer coaching to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it.
