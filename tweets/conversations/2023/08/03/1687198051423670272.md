@StroutMotivateU It's intentionally ridiculously cheap.

I want to make it a no-brainer, but I think I need to ramp it up a little faster than I was planning.

So I'm probably going to keep the max tier there for the first 5 people, then raise it up each group of 5 after, up to a max of 20 or so.â€¦
