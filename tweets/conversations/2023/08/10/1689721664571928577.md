@anshulshuks @_buildspace @_nightsweekends @FarzaTV I like this. It's tough to figure out what the actual research says right now. A lot of hype and a lot of fear-mongering out there.

Nice communication of the idea too. I don't know if you need the last line though. Removing that keeps it nice and clear.
