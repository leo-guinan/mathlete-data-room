@NewWrldOptimist that's the truth, isn't it?

I see ways all the time that I *could* make a ton of money. It wouldn't be terribly hard and not risky at all. 

But it doesn't align with what I want to be associated with. 

Also, in the end, long-term thinking and behaviors will pay off way better.â€¦
