Sometimes it feels like the universe is trying to tell you something.

Saw this right after listening to @CoreyWilksPsyD, @justinmulvs, and Rikki talk about this on No Clear Answers.

Highly recommend the episode for going deeper on this concept, it's something I'm sitting withâ€¦ https://t.co/AlGQVcqa14
