@p_millerd @MiguelMayher @MrBeast @AlexHormozi It seems super simple, doesn't it?

But we live in a world of performative communication. It's not about what you do, it's about what you say you do and who you say it to.

(that's corporate life in a nutshell, and my biggest complaint of it, and it just extended to social media)
