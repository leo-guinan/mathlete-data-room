@DavidDeutschOxf @MatjazLeonardis That's the model I've been working on. It's a quantum model that realizes prices are extremely compressed pieces of data that are impacted by the presence of observers. 

+it does actually offer a model for a functional AGI architecture, it just doesn't look like what ppl expect.
