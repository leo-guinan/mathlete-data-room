@tomosman @crewAIInc @joaomdmoura In a way, that's very much what I'm working on. Although I think the idea of "businesses" is a bit of a loaded term in that it contains a lot of complexity. 

But if you think about businesses as networks of people  that communicate for economic gains, I'm building better pipes.
