@arvidkahl @dvassallo @levelsio One of the biggest issues with uncovering it: we don't ask people for information we don't see the value in. 

That's why social media is so interesting, because it's a way for people to share unstructured thoughts.

I'd argue that the most valuable shares are the ones not seen.
