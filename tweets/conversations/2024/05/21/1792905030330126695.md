@FAfied32 @awpthorp @gregisenberg Mostly agree, but I'd argue that the knowledge graph doesn't need to be agreed on, nor should it be. the knowledge graph needs to shift and change as new information flows in. But accessible yes, and it should be able to have sharable views of the graph  at a given time.
