@HausOfErostribe @StroutMotivateU @pronounced_kyle That's how I'm tending to approach monetizing products lately, because I've tried many times to build things in hope they get used. 

But more and more, I've realized it's easier to sell to a single person than it is to people at scale. 

And thank you for the kind words! :)
