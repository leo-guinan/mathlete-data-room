@BhavaniRavi_ @_buildspace @_nightsweekends I want to explore communities as a "business" of sorts. So I'll build out a number of ideas and let members of the community use them as building blocks for their own service offerings.

Once members prove that the tools are economically viable, the tools can be built out more.
