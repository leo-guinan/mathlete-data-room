@emerginghope_ @_buildspace I've definitely done some interviews before for other projects, and that's a great idea! 

Also gave me a similar idea to write up case studies based on other people talking about similar ideas. Simon Sinek comes to mind because I just watched an episode of The Diary of a CEO.
