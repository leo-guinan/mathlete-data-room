@fluttermatt @FarzaTV Code progress is easy. You can do that whenever. People progress is hard. The best code is the code you don't have to write before finding out it isn't valuable.

As someone who has written a lot of code to avoid talking to people, you're making better progress than you think ðŸ˜€
