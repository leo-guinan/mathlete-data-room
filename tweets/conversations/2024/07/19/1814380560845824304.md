@DefenderOfBasic @Nymdok This is actually where I think AI can come in and help. It can hold way more context than any human, and if costs of solutions drop, it becomes easier to test, evaluate, switch, evaluate. 

But most people are limited by time and money, so they look to the "obvious" answer.
