@HausOfErostribe @Astranis (ðŸ¤« my ultimate goal is to build things out and hire a team of people to maintain them and keep them up, because I'm there too with custom apps)

But I also don't think we need to maintain apps as much. I think there's room for ephemeral apps that come and go as needed.
