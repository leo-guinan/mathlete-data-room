@DefenderOfBasic @IsaacKing314 I think we've overcomplicated this a lot. 

"In order to learn, you have to go to school"

"In order to be qualified, you need to be certified by someone else"

We've increased the perceived coordination needed to learn, which prevents people from learning on their own.
