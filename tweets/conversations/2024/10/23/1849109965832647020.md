@hakanderyal @finereli @mem0ai Hmm, I built my own too, but this might actually make a good bit of what I'm planning to implement easier. 

There was something I was thinking about doing that should be trivial with @mem0ai. Need to check out the docs a bit! Thanks for the poke, I wanted to check them out.
