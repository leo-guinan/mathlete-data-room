@DefenderOfBasic Status signifiers work when they aren't well known enough to be a target of the majority of participants in the system. 

Otherwise, their signal ends up being less and less valuable over time because when everyone is using the same signal,  it's not a signal. 

Gotta be a movingâ€¦
