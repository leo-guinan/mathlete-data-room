@DefenderOfBasic @nosilverv I personally like weed as a way to move along the embodiment spectrum.

I spent most of my life trying to move out of my body and into my head, and the last few years trying to learn how to communicate with my body again.

Weed helps me slow down the natural high-speed thoughtâ€¦
