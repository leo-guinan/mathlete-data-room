@DefenderOfBasic @jbraunstein914 It helps if every other car would broadcast it's exact location as a way to validate the sensors too, although that level of broadcasting would be really noisy. Seems like there could be an algorithm to regularly validate though, maybe even a sort of active ping/connection whenâ€¦
