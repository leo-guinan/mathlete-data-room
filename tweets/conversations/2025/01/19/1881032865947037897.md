@michelleakin Uh, makes you even more awesome!

You know who else is a little uncouth? My new friend Lucas. He took advantage of a baby pool we use to give our dog a bath and set it up as his swimming pool in front of our shed. 

Neighbors might call him uncouth too. 

But we cool. https://t.co/rv8o9xlhgD
