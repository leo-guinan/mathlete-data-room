@mikulaja @RoryOReilly @jsawadd Would love to chat. I'm working on Human Insurance, because I realized we've mispriced risk in the economy: everyone gets to price risk into their economic models except for people. 

That creates an incredible opportunity to bet on people at a time when everyone is focused on AIâ€¦
