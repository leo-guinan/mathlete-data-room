@DonaldH49964496 @ZenMarmot @jon_vs_moloch @littIeramblings Because you don't insure the prevention of bad things with insurance. There's an infinite number of things you are trying to protect against in your calculations and still be able to take profit.

You insure the continuation of something good by outpredicting the bad.
