@connerdelights @DefenderOfBasic @suntzoogway The way to solve this is via memetic compression. you don't have to calculate it for all accounts individually as a constant value. You can fuzz it just enough that you should be able to calculate it locally and figure on the fly if someone is similar enough to previous peopleâ€¦
