@geo_anima @BuildInPublicU Yes, but in this case, I'm anti-memetic in terms of this specific environment. Instead of being terse, witty, and funny, my focus is on depth of knowledge, sharing my thinking as I'm thinking, and basically acting as a network professor.

So I'm focusing on long-term stabilityâ€¦
