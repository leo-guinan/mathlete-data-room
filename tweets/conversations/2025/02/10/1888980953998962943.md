@NathanSRobinson @JacobColling WOT was amazing and that's actually how I jumped into Stormlight.

Stormlight was funny for me, because I didn't get into it as easily as I do with every book. But I had to work a bit on the first one. Once I got my head tapped into the world though, I blasted through all of themâ€¦
