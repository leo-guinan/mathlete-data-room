@DeskPopper69 @rakyll @tummycom What's wealth?

Ultimately, wealth is freedom, and that's what my model offers, because it's non-coercive in nature.

That means it creates a standard to which all other systems must compete, or they will die out.

You don't need to take anything from the past when you can get itâ€¦
