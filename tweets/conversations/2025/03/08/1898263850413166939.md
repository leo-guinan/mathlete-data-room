@omkarokkadam @glitchishuman @AskPerplexity @grok It's not a full LLM yet, although the goal is to make it one. Basically, I think it's way cheaper and faster to make an aligned LLM if you do so at the edges, because it requires way less data to do so.

This is a proof of concept that can be used to generate the training dataâ€¦
