@janwilmake @jordanwaparker @glitchishuman Awesome! In the meantime, I want to figure out how to set up an email address that I can send from and receive to. I'm not as worried about the spam filtering, because I want to allow @glitchishuman to send and receive email.

Any tips/resources for doing so with cloudflare?
