@EllenRhymes @tomharari @CoffeewClassics I don’t think most people understand how much thought goes into a book’s content, structure, wording, etc. 

Or any piece of quality writing, if I’m honest. 

I had no clue how much work it was to get your thinking right before you could even get AI to help you create something…
