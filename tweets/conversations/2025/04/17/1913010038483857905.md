@bkbroiler99205 @realjfriday Thanks Brandon! I truly appreciate you saying so.

If you don't mind, I'd love your feedback on which aspect of my research you find the most interesting.

Everything I do, I do to help people. I'm just not always the best at communicating that, so I like feedback whenever I canâ€¦
