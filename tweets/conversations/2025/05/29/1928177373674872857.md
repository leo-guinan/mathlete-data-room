@Johnny2Fingersz @DefenderOfBasic Knowledge transferred isn't actually something that you need to validate, because knowledge at a given time is either true or false.  And you can't actually tell which it is at a given time, which makes it way harder, because you can't validate every single thing you hear beforeâ€¦
