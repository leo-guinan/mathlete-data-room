@PeterVanNess33 @mudscryer Please feel free to plug your work! I'm actually typically really bad at plugging my own because I'd rather do it than talk about it, so I'm always excited when others can do it more easily. 

Will definitely check it out, because it sounds right up my alley! Thanks for sharing!
