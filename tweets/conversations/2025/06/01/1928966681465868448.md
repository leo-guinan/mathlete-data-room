@thisiskp_ @gregisenberg @EricSimons @boltdotnew If you try to beat a complex system by integrating into it, you'll lose by eventually having to add too much complexity. You simply surround it and monitor it to understand where the inputs and outputs are, and then build a replacement that plugs into the api you've learned.
