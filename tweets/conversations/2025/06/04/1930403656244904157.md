@workflowsauce That’s a dangerous way to think. I’ve tried not being thirsty, I’ve tried being thirsty, I’ve tried everything. 

I waited 5 years, and now I refuse to go any longer without drinking. A friend is worse off than I am and I haven’t been able to help him. This solves both. https://t.co/sLekV1oqql
