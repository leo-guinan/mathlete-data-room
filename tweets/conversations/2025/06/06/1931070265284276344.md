@crypto_foxtrot @Noahpinion @elonmusk It's not valuable for people to give it to them, because they don't have the money to spend. 

So the future goes on by without them because they can't afford any of it.

So they don't care about watching it all burn. Why would they? They don't have a stake in it winning.
