@Johnny2Fingersz @mykola Nope. Complexity is the defense against itself. As a system becomes more complex, it’s able to do things a smaller system couldn’t. 

But if complexity isn’t cleaned up along the way, it will overwhelm and bog down the system. So the answer is to have incentives around cleanup.
