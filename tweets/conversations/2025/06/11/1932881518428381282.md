@NewWrldOptimist @thePartyPartyUS Yep. I had no clue, but it explains how when I joined the workforce, I ended up doubling in weight over the course of a decade and on a cocktail of meds to try to keep going every day, because the system crushed my soul.

It's time to kill those systems, once and for all.
