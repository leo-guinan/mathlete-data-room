@borkedsys I don’t have to imagine it. 

I’ve designed it, and am now implementing it. 

Internet 2.0 is the path. It’s a rejection of the web2, web3 bullshit we’ve been feed by tech and a return to the weird early Internet.  The human Internet. 

And we are going to make it smart. https://t.co/ea7N19vXu0
