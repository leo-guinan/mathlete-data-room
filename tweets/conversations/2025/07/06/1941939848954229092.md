@ChrisChipMonk It's my initial implementation of Internet 2.0. A human internet.

I've been building it for 5 years, because I saw the problems, and I have 5 years of building in public to prove it. I'm just now putting it into action, because I finally figured out the architecture that works. https://t.co/JCYt0AYMlH
