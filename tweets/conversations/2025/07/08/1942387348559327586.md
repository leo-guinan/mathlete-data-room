@alegator_cs @DefenderOfBasic @samsenchal @speakerjohnash @IntuitMachine @PrincessPastry_ @hammer_mt @virtual_rf @alchemicAV I'm using AI to specifically decrease my own entropy of understanding and ignoring most of the outputs of the AI in order to zero in on what I was looking for. 

I have absolutely zero attachment to the models and simply am searching for information that I know exists within.
