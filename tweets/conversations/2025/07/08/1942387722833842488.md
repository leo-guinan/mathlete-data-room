@alegator_cs @DefenderOfBasic @samsenchal @speakerjohnash @IntuitMachine @PrincessPastry_ @hammer_mt @virtual_rf @alchemicAV yes, but darwinian in a hypercompetitive game where the players have no idea what the actual game is, because there are so many people running their own games simultaneously, it's impossible to untangle them all.

So random, more than based on actual environment. not great.
