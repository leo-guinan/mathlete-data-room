@dagorenouf @LaLaIndieMaker @brianball I used to think all I needed was an idea. The right idea was all it would take, and I’d break free. 

And then I had the idea. 

And I was right. I did break free. 

But I wasn’t successful. That’s in the process of flipping, 5 years after the idea. 

The right idea to the right…
