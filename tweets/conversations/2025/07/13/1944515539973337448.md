@EMostaque I have to ground it with the project context. When I give it the shape of the problem I want to solve, it helps me pull the equations out. 

For example, I used Claude to help me create the calculus of time which represents time not as a coordination number but rather a changeâ€¦ https://t.co/By2nox11CK
