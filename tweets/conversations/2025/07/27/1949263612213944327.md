@mykola @vixamechana It was a fun get together but the end of the hackathon felt very hollow. 

For as much hype as went into the beginning, it felt like a fizzle ending. 

But I did my ritual beforehand and so I was able to appreciate the win I got, the real win. 

The narrative has become reality.
