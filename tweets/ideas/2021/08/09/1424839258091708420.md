One of the biggest mistakes when trying to get DeFiNet off the ground was trying to make everything happen at once. 

I completely burnt myself out doing it that way. Now, I'm making sure that I'm heading the right direction. But I don't care when I get there. And I'm happier. https://t.co/LR6HS8Gp8e
