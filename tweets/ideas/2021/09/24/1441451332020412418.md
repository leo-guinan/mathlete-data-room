Thinking about this, this is how I would make it work.

Typeform with 2 ?s, name and location
From there, add to Google sheet/notion table/airtable 
When row added to table, add pin to Google map with name as the label

Or you could build a product that does that under the hood.. https://t.co/FG6z22PSpl
