It's been a busy week. Both kids showed animals at the county fair earlier in the week and now we are spending all day at a swim meet.

It's pretty cool to see an Olympic training facility though. Only had to get up a couple of hours before dawn and drive 3.5 hours to get here https://t.co/SZt9wvfraK
