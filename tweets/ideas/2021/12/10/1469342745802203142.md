This is something that I struggled with for a long time. I embraced the lazy aspect as part of my personality. It became a self fulfilling prophecy.

Realizing it was ADHD the whole time allowed me to reframe my view of the past. And have a lot more self compassion/fix things https://t.co/9dlNJ9LtCB
