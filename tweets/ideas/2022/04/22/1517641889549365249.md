Great thread on masking. When I figured out I was masking, I was determined to never do so.

I realized it's not quite that easy. But as long as I don't have to mask all the time, as long as I give myself room to feel my feelings and figure out how to understand them, I'm ok. https://t.co/RQZRSEmRmM
