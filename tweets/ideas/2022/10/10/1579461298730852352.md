Great thread by Ross.

It's OK to struggle. We all do, to various extents and degrees.

I know I've gone through a number of struggles myself, and continue to do so. I feel the same anxiety over not working all the time. 

Talking about it helps a ton. Like Ross, DMs are open. https://t.co/0AYTmydKXN
