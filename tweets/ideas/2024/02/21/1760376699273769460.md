Correction: It's easier to monetize in the short-term.

But in the long-term, it doesn't come close.

That's a function of an inefficient conversion of attention to money.

This happens because we try to monetize attention in the moment, instead of monetizing based on compounding https://t.co/M1NosrsYHP
