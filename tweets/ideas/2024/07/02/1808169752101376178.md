Love what Daren is doing here, because it's another example of an abundant system that can beat out a scarce system.

The studio model is a scarce system; it incentivizes bloat because long-term incentives aren't aligned, so everyone has to get as much out as possible up front. https://t.co/GuIAj4bt0g
