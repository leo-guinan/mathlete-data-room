This is actually the solution to Goodhart's Law, by the way. 

You aren't measuring when something happens, you are measuring the risk of it not happening.

When your goal is reducing risk vs hitting targets, you measure to get an idea of the risk and you can be much moreâ€¦ https://t.co/te3oFypZr5
