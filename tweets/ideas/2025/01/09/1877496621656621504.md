If people don’t know what your product does, and expect one thing only for you to do another, it’s on your marketing. 

You can’t fucking tell people that you’ll be there when they need you and then bail. 

Your marketing sucks. Your business model sucks. 

Time for a new one. https://t.co/Yk5dyeAg0n
