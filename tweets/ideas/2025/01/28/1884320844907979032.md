It’s a broken economy when this amount of work will go into outcomes that are uncertain. 

That’s labor being done in speculation because security doesn’t exist.  

If they are doing it in hope of economic gain. 

It might also just be fun, which is awesome too. 

Either way… https://t.co/FgDULFcsFq
