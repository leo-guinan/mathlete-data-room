Building a tribal simulator because I was curious about tribal dynamics based on value systems and random encounters.

Starting off simple with a friendly/hostile encounter, with a given number of hostile encounters in a row leading to "death"

Was kinda cool to see how quicklyâ€¦ https://t.co/3wqclBi0cR
