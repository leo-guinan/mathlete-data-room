I love that Balaji is highlighting this for AIs. But the problem is actually worse than he realizes: we have the same problem verifying people.

He's got Network States, but they can't validate anything quickly. That's what everything I'm doing fixes. It rewards the validation. https://t.co/UuNK57cHXD
