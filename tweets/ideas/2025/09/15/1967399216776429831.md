Weird question, but do I know anyone who knows anyone who is doing anything with research into Parkinson's?

A friend's dad has it, and I was doing a bit of digging into it, and tried modeling a sequence of treatments that could show promise. 

Do I have anyone who can look overâ€¦ https://t.co/Yv8rU80g71
