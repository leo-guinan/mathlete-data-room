really</c><00:00:58.260><c> fascinated</c><00:00:58.680><c> by</c><00:00:58.920><c> the</c><00:00:59.039><c> idea</c> I've been really fascinated by the idea I've been really fascinated by the idea of<00:00:59.699><c> having</c><00:01:00.000><c> these</c><00:01:00.539><c> autonomous</c><00:01:01.140><c> agents</c><00:01:02.160><c> if</c> of having these autonomous agents if of having these autonomous agents if you've<00:01:03.000><c> seen</c><00:01:03.239><c> baby</c><00:01:03.780><c> AGI</c><00:01:04.559><c> or</c> you've seen baby AGI or you've seen baby AGI or Auto<00:01:06.659><c> GPT</c> Auto GPT Auto GPT you<00:01:09.600><c> might</c><00:01:09.720><c> have</c><00:01:09.960><c> noticed</c><00:01:10.619><c> that</c><00:01:11.100><c> people</c><00:01:11.820><c> are</c> you might have noticed that people are you might have noticed that people are trying<00:01:12.600><c> to</c><00:01:12.780><c> use</c><00:01:12.900><c> these</c><00:01:13.200><c> for</c><00:01:13.320><c> all</c><00:01:13.439><c> sorts</c><00:01:13.680><c> of</c> trying to use these for all sorts of trying to use these for all sorts of things<00:01:13.860><c> and</c><00:01:14.280><c> basically</c><00:01:14.700><c> the</c><00:01:15.000><c> idea</c><00:01:15.240><c> is</c><00:01:15.479><c> that</c> things and basically the idea is that things and basically the idea is that you<00:01:15.720><c> give</c><00:01:15.900><c> it</c><00:01:16.020><c> a</c><00:01:16.200><c> task</c><00:01:16.700><c> and</c><00:01:17.700><c> it</c><00:01:18.060><c> will</c><00:01:18.180><c> go</c><00:01:18.360><c> out</c> you give it a task and it will go out you give it a task and it will go out and<00:01:18.960><c> do</c><00:01:19.439><c> whatever</c><00:01:19.619><c> you</c><00:01:19.920><c> want</c><00:01:20.040><c> it</c><00:01:20.159><c> to</c><00:01:20.220><c> do</c> and do whatever you want it to do and do whatever you want it to do and and and I<00:01:25.140><c> haven't</c><00:01:25.200><c> been</c><00:01:25.439><c> able</c><00:01:25.619><c> to</c><00:01:25.680><c> get</c><00:01:25.799><c> it</c><00:01:25.920><c> to</c><00:01:25.979><c> do</c> I haven't been able to get it to do I haven't been able to get it to do anything<00:01:26.280><c> particularly</c><00:01:26.880><c> useful</c> anything particularly useful anything particularly useful usually<00:01:28.820><c> it</c><00:01:29.820><c> tries</c><00:01:30.119><c> really</c><00:01:30.360><c> hard</c><00:01:30.600><c> but</c><00:01:31.080><c> then</c><00:01:31.200><c> it</c> usually it tries really hard but then it usually it tries really hard but then it like<00:01:31.500><c> spins</c><00:01:31.860><c> in</c><00:01:32.040><c> circles</c><00:01:32.400><c> and</c><00:01:32.700><c> then</c><00:01:32.820><c> it's</c><00:01:33.000><c> like</c> like spins in circles and then it's like like spins in circles and then it's like I'm<00:01:33.479><c> gonna</c><00:01:33.659><c> go</c><00:01:33.780><c> do</c><00:01:33.900><c> this</c><00:01:34.020><c> thing</c><00:01:34.140><c> and</c><00:01:34.380><c> realize</c> I'm gonna go do this thing and realize I'm gonna go do this thing and realize it<00:01:34.979><c> can't</c><00:01:35.100><c> do</c><00:01:35.280><c> the</c><00:01:35.400><c> thing</c> it can't do the thing it can't do the thing so<00:01:36.659><c> it'll</c><00:01:36.840><c> like</c><00:01:37.020><c> pretend</c><00:01:37.380><c> to</c><00:01:37.500><c> do</c><00:01:37.619><c> the</c><00:01:37.740><c> thing</c> so it'll like pretend to do the thing so it'll like pretend to do the thing here's<00:01:38.700><c> a</c><00:01:38.820><c> great</c><00:01:38.880><c> example</c><00:01:39.240><c> I</c><00:01:40.020><c> was</c><00:01:40.680><c> trying</c><00:01:40.979><c> to</c> here's a great example I was trying to here's a great example I was trying to get get get one<00:01:43.200><c> two</c> one two one two be<00:01:46.200><c> a</c> be a be a Ghostwriter<00:01:48.119><c> of</c><00:01:48.360><c> tweets</c> Ghostwriter of tweets Ghostwriter of tweets and<00:01:51.000><c> so</c><00:01:51.360><c> it</c><00:01:51.659><c> decided</c><00:01:52.020><c> that</c><00:01:52.140><c> it</c><00:01:52.259><c> was</c><00:01:52.380><c> going</c><00:01:52.439><c> to</c> and so it decided that it was going to and so it decided that it was going to do<00:01:52.619><c> all</c><00:01:52.799><c> this</c><00:01:52.920><c> research</c><00:01:53.340><c> and</c><00:01:54.240><c> great</c><00:01:54.720><c> it</c><00:01:55.320><c> maybe</c> do all this research and great it maybe do all this research and great it maybe pulled<00:01:56.759><c> some</c><00:01:56.820><c> search</c><00:01:57.000><c> results</c><00:01:57.180><c> or</c><00:01:57.479><c> something</c> pulled some search results or something pulled some search results or something but<00:01:58.680><c> then</c><00:01:58.799><c> it</c><00:01:58.979><c> was</c><00:01:59.100><c> going</c><00:01:59.340><c> to</c><00:01:59.460><c> like</c> but then it was going to like but then it was going to like figure<00:02:01.259><c> out</c><00:02:01.439><c> how</c><00:02:01.740><c> to</c><00:02:01.860><c> analyze</c><00:02:02.520><c> tweets</c><00:02:02.880><c> and</c><00:02:03.780><c> so</c> figure out how to analyze tweets and so figure out how to analyze tweets and so it's<00:02:04.079><c> like</c><00:02:04.259><c> I'll</c><00:02:04.619><c> just</c><00:02:04.799><c> call</c><00:02:04.979><c> analyze</c> it's like I'll just call analyze it's like I'll just call analyze tweets.pi<00:02:06.780><c> which</c><00:02:07.140><c> didn't</c><00:02:07.380><c> exist</c> tweets.pi which didn't exist tweets.pi which didn't exist and<00:02:09.239><c> so</c><00:02:09.479><c> it's</c><00:02:09.899><c> like</c><00:02:10.080><c> fine</c><00:02:10.319><c> I'll</c><00:02:10.739><c> write</c><00:02:10.920><c> analyze</c> and so it's like fine I'll write analyze and so it's like fine I'll write analyze dot<00:02:12.000><c> pi</c> dot pi dot pi and and and so<00:02:15.840><c> it</c><00:02:16.140><c> did</c><00:02:16.260><c> that</c><00:02:16.440><c> but</c><00:02:16.739><c> then</c><00:02:16.860><c> I</c><00:02:16.980><c> got</c><00:02:17.099><c> an</c><00:02:17.220><c> error</c> so it did that but then I got an error so it did that but then I got an error message message message and<00:02:18.900><c> so</c><00:02:19.020><c> I</c><00:02:19.140><c> decided</c><00:02:19.500><c> to</c><00:02:19.560><c> like</c><00:02:19.680><c> rewrite</c><00:02:20.099><c> it</c><00:02:20.400><c> and</c> and so I decided to like rewrite it and and so I decided to like rewrite it and it<00:02:23.280><c> just</c><00:02:23.400><c> had</c><00:02:23.580><c> a</c><00:02:23.760><c> comment</c><00:02:24.060><c> that</c><00:02:24.959><c> was</c><00:02:25.080><c> like</c> it just had a comment that was like it just had a comment that was like analyze<00:02:26.459><c> tweets</c> analyze tweets analyze tweets which<00:02:28.980><c> is</c><00:02:29.160><c> funny</c><00:02:29.640><c> because</c><00:02:29.879><c> then</c><00:02:30.060><c> it</c><00:02:30.300><c> ran</c><00:02:30.540><c> it</c> which is funny because then it ran it which is funny because then it ran it and<00:02:30.900><c> it</c><00:02:31.080><c> ran</c><00:02:31.260><c> it</c><00:02:31.379><c> successfully</c> and it ran it successfully and it ran it successfully but<00:02:33.360><c> it</c><00:02:33.480><c> didn't</c><00:02:33.599><c> actually</c><00:02:33.840><c> do</c><00:02:34.140><c> anything</c> but it didn't actually do anything but it didn't actually do anything

I</c><00:05:47.880><c> wanted</c><00:05:48.060><c> it</c><00:05:48.300><c> would</c><00:05:48.419><c> make</c><00:05:48.539><c> up</c><00:05:48.720><c> its</c><00:05:49.020><c> own</c> steps I wanted it would make up its own steps I wanted it would make up its own it<00:05:49.979><c> would</c><00:05:50.160><c> occasionally</c><00:05:50.460><c> do</c><00:05:50.699><c> some</c><00:05:50.940><c>

decided</c><00:05:52.440><c> to</c><00:05:52.440><c> constrain</c> things and so I decided to constrain things and so I decided to constrain this<00:05:53.100><c> a</c><00:05:53.220><c> bit</c><00:05:53.340><c> more</c><00:05:53.580><c> and</c><00:05:54.479><c> just</c><00:05:54.720><c> have</c><00:05:54.960><c> this</c><00:05:55.199><c> Ghost</c> this a bit more and just have this

specific</c> Writer write Tweets in a very specific Writer write Tweets in a very specific way<00:05:58.280><c> and</c><00:05:59.280><c> so</c><00:05:59.520><c> I'm</c><00:05:59.940><c> gonna</c><00:06:00.060><c> chain</c><00:06:00.419><c> together</c> way and so I'm gonna chain together way and so I'm gonna chain together multiple<00:06:01.500><c> calls</c><00:06:01.979><c> in</c><00:06:02.759><c> order</c><00:06:02.880><c> to</c><00:06:03.660><c> make</c><00:06:04.560><c> it</c> multiple calls in order to make it multiple calls in order to make it

still</c> behave the way I want and so it still behave the way I want and so it still has<00:06:07.199><c> a</c><00:06:07.500><c> level</c><00:06:07.620><c> of</c><00:06:08.160><c> flexibility</c><00:06:09.060><c> there</c><00:06:09.479><c> and</c> has a level of flexibility there and has a level of flexibility there and creativity<00:06:10.259><c> that</c><00:06:10.560><c> it</c><00:06:10.680><c> can</c><00:06:10.860><c> take</c><00:06:11.039><c> in</c><00:06:11.580><c> specific</c> creativity that it can take in specific creativity that it can take in specific

the steps but overall the structure of the process<00:06:15.479><c> it's</c><00:06:15.780><c> taking</c><00:06:16.039><c> is</c><00:06:17.039><c> controlled</c><00:06:17.460><c> and</c><00:06:17.759><c> I</c> process it's taking is controlled and I process it's taking is controlled and I think<00:06:17.940><c> this</c><00:06:18.180><c> is</c><00:06:18.300><c> actually</c><00:06:18.539><c> a</c><00:06:18.780><c> very</c><00:06:18.900><c> powerful</c> think this is actually a very powerful think this is actually a very powerful way<00:06:19.440><c> to</c><00:06:19.560><c> think</c><00:06:19.680><c> of</c><00:06:19.860><c> things</c><00:06:19.979><c> instead</c><00:06:20.400><c> of</c><00:06:20.520><c> making</c> way to think of things instead of making way to think of things instead of making it<00:06:21.000><c> all</c><00:06:21.180><c> autonomous</c><00:06:21.800><c> put</c><00:06:22.800><c> it</c><00:06:22.919><c> in</c><00:06:23.160><c> these</c><00:06:23.400><c> very</c> it all autonomous put it in these very it all autonomous put it in these very constrained<00:06:24.120><c> flows</c><00:06:24.860><c> and</c><00:06:25.860><c> use</c><00:06:26.280><c> that</c><00:06:26.520><c> to</c> constrained flows and use that to constrained flows and use that to actually<00:06:26.940><c> accomplish</c><00:06:27.419><c> something</c><00:06:27.600><c> and</c><00:06:28.440><c> so</c><00:06:28.620><c> now</c> actually accomplish something and so now actually accomplish something and so now what<00:06:29.580><c> I</c><00:06:29.699><c> can</c><00:06:29.819><c> do</c><00:06:29.940><c> is</c><00:06:30.060><c> I</c><00:06:30.240><c> can</c><00:06:30.360><c> actually</c><00:06:30.479><c> send</c><00:06:30.780><c> an</c> what I can do is I can actually send an what I can do is I can actually send an API<00:06:31.319><c> request</c><00:06:31.880><c> and</c><00:06:32.880><c> it</c><00:06:33.300><c> will</c><00:06:33.620><c> go</c><00:06:34.620><c> in</c><00:06:34.800><c> and</c> API request and it will go in and API request and it will go in and ultimately<00:06:35.639><c> I</c><00:06:35.880><c> had</c><00:06:36.000><c> this</c><00:06:36.120><c> idea</c><00:06:36.419><c> of</c><00:06:36.539><c> like</c> ultimately I had this idea of like ultimately I had this idea of like having<00:06:36.840><c> like</c><00:06:37.020><c> a</c><00:06:37.259><c> receptionist</c><00:06:37.800><c> node</c><00:06:38.160><c> that</c> having like a receptionist node that having like a receptionist node that will will will figure<00:06:40.440><c> out</c><00:06:40.680><c> how</c><00:06:40.979><c> to</c><00:06:41.100><c> route</c><00:06:41.220><c> the</c><00:06:41.460><c> request</c><00:06:41.699><c> I</c> figure out how to route the request I figure out how to route the request I may<00:06:42.240><c> end</c><00:06:42.419><c> up</c><00:06:42.479><c> changing</c><00:06:42.900><c> this</c><00:06:43.020><c> a</c><00:06:43.199><c> bit</c><00:06:43.319><c> but</c> may end up changing this a bit but may end up changing this a bit but ultimately<00:06:44.880><c> that</c><00:06:45.240><c> that's</c><00:06:45.419><c> kind</c><00:06:45.660><c> of</c><00:06:45.780><c> the</c><00:06:45.840><c> way</c> ultimately that that's kind of the way ultimately that that's kind of the way I'm<00:06:46.080><c> thinking</c><00:06:46.319><c> about</c><00:06:46.440><c> it</c><00:06:46.680><c> is</c><00:06:46.860><c> like</c><00:06:47.220><c> okay</c><00:06:48.060><c> so</c><00:06:48.419><c> it</c> I'm thinking about it is like okay so it I'm thinking about it is like okay so it comes<00:06:48.960><c> in</c><00:06:49.139><c> we</c><00:06:49.979><c> have</c><00:06:50.160><c> some</c><00:06:50.400><c> sort</c><00:06:50.639><c> of</c><00:06:50.759><c> agent</c><00:06:51.360><c> for</c> comes in we have some sort of agent for comes in we have some sort of agent for routing<00:06:51.960><c> so</c><00:06:52.139><c> the</c><00:06:52.319><c> the</c><00:06:52.500><c> receptionist</c><00:06:53.039><c> in</c><00:06:53.280><c> the</c> routing so the the receptionist in the routing so the the receptionist in the office<00:06:53.460><c> building</c><00:06:53.759><c> if</c><00:06:54.000><c> you</c><00:06:54.180><c>
