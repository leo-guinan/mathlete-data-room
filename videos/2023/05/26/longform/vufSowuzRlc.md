that<00:00:56.879><c> one</c><00:00:57.000><c> as</c><00:00:57.600><c> I</c><00:00:57.840><c> fell</c><00:00:58.020><c> flat</c><00:00:58.320><c> on</c><00:00:58.440><c> my</c><00:00:58.559><c> face</c><00:00:58.680><c> with</c> that one as I fell flat on my face with that one as I fell flat on my face with my<00:00:58.980><c> first</c><00:00:59.100><c> startup</c><00:00:59.460><c> but</c><00:01:00.420><c> I've</c><00:01:00.840><c> learned</c><00:01:01.020><c> a</c><00:01:01.140><c> lot</c> my first startup but I've learned a lot my first startup but I've learned a lot in<00:01:01.320><c> the</c><00:01:01.440><c> process</c><00:01:01.680><c> and</c><00:01:02.219><c> so</c><00:01:02.579><c> one</c><00:01:03.420><c> of</c><00:01:03.539><c> the</c><00:01:03.660><c> things</c> in the process and so one of the things in the process and so one of the things to<00:01:04.080><c> really</c><00:01:04.260><c> realize</c><00:01:04.739><c> is</c><00:01:05.400><c> that</c><00:01:05.880><c> a</c><00:01:06.540><c> startup</c> to really realize is that a startup to really realize is that a startup is<00:01:08.820><c> a</c> is a is a problem problem problem Discovery<00:01:14.220><c> machine</c><00:01:14.400><c> and</c><00:01:15.180><c> so</c><00:01:15.299><c> what</c><00:01:15.420><c> I</c><00:01:15.540><c> mean</c><00:01:15.659><c> by</c> Discovery machine and so what I mean by Discovery machine and so what I mean by this<00:01:16.080><c> is</c><00:01:16.860><c> as</c><00:01:17.460><c> you're</c><00:01:17.640><c> trying</c><00:01:17.820><c> to</c><00:01:17.939><c> build</c><00:01:18.060><c> a</c> this is as you're trying to build a this is as you're trying to build a startup startup startup your<00:01:20.340><c> goal</c><00:01:20.700><c> should</c><00:01:21.420><c> be</c><00:01:21.740><c> to</c><00:01:22.740><c> validate</c><00:01:23.220><c> that</c><00:01:23.400><c> a</c> your goal should be to validate that a your goal should be to validate that a problem<00:01:23.700><c> exists</c> problem exists problem exists that<00:01:25.500><c> is</c><00:01:25.619><c> the</c><00:01:25.860><c> first</c><00:01:26.040><c> and</c><00:01:26.220><c> foremost</c><00:01:26.640><c> thing</c><00:01:26.880><c> and</c> that is the first and foremost thing and that is the first and foremost thing and this<00:01:27.299><c> is</c><00:01:27.360><c> something</c><00:01:27.600><c> that</c><00:01:27.900><c> I</c><00:01:28.080><c> am</c><00:01:28.259><c> saying</c> this is something that I am saying this is something that I am saying mostly<00:01:28.740><c> to</c><00:01:28.979><c> remind</c><00:01:29.220><c> myself</c><00:01:29.520><c> of</c><00:01:29.880><c> that</c><00:01:30.119><c> a</c><00:01:30.840><c> lot</c><00:01:30.960><c> of</c> mostly to remind myself of that a lot of mostly to remind myself of that a lot of times<00:01:31.080><c> you</c><00:01:31.200><c> think</c><00:01:31.320><c> of</c><00:01:31.500><c> a</c><00:01:31.560><c> startup</c><00:01:31.799><c> and</c><00:01:31.920><c> you</c> times you think of a startup and you times you think of a startup and you think<00:01:32.159><c> like</c><00:01:32.340><c> I've</c><00:01:32.580><c> got</c><00:01:32.759><c> to</c><00:01:32.880><c> build</c><00:01:33.000><c> something</c> think like I've got to build something think like I've got to build something in<00:01:33.720><c> fact</c><00:01:33.900><c> I</c><00:01:34.080><c> was</c><00:01:34.259><c> just</c><00:01:34.380><c> on</c><00:01:34.560><c> a</c><00:01:34.740><c> podcast</c><00:01:34.860><c> talking</c> in fact I was just on a podcast talking in fact I was just on a podcast talking about<00:01:35.640><c> this</c> about this about this and and and we we we we're<00:01:40.079><c> talking</c><00:01:40.320><c> about</c><00:01:40.619><c> this</c><00:01:40.979><c> kind</c><00:01:41.159><c> of</c><00:01:41.280><c> natural</c> we're talking about this kind of natural we're talking about this kind of natural inclination<00:01:42.119><c> for</c><00:01:42.360><c> people</c><00:01:42.479><c> especially</c> inclination for people especially inclination for people especially Engineers<00:01:43.560><c> to</c><00:01:43.860><c> just</c><00:01:44.159><c> like</c><00:01:44.400><c> build</c><00:01:45.000><c> build</c><00:01:45.240><c> build</c> Engineers to just like build build build Engineers to just like build build build I'm<00:01:46.500><c> going</c><00:01:46.619><c> to</c><00:01:46.799><c> build</c><00:01:46.979><c> this</c><00:01:47.280><c> and</c><00:01:48.000><c> people</c><00:01:48.540><c> will</c> I'm going to build this and people will I'm going to build this and people will love<00:01:48.960><c> it</c> love it love it and<00:01:50.759><c> ultimately</c><00:01:51.720><c> a</c><00:01:52.200><c> startup</c><00:01:52.500><c> is</c><00:01:52.740><c> not</c><00:01:53.040><c> a</c> and ultimately a startup is not a and ultimately a startup is not a product<00:01:53.700><c> producing</c><00:01:54.479><c> machine</c><00:01:54.899><c> it</c><00:01:55.680><c> is</c><00:01:55.860><c> a</c> product producing machine it is a product producing machine it is a problem<00:01:56.520><c> validating</c><00:01:57.479><c> machine</c> problem validating machine problem validating machine so<00:01:59.220><c> when</c><00:01:59.520><c> you</c><00:01:59.640><c> want</c><00:01:59.759><c> to</c><00:01:59.880><c> build</c><00:01:59.939><c> a</c><00:02:00.119><c> startup</c><00:02:00.560><c> your</c> so when you want to build a startup your so when you want to build a startup your first<00:02:01.740><c> goal</c><00:02:02.220><c> should</c><00:02:02.460><c> be</c><00:02:02.640><c> to</c><00:02:03.240><c> validate</c><00:02:03.780><c> that</c> first goal should be to validate that first goal should be to validate that there<00:02:04.320><c> is</c><00:02:04.500><c> a</c><00:02:04.740><c> problem</c><00:02:04.920><c> and</c><00:02:05.460><c> that</c><00:02:05.520><c> there's</c> there is a problem and that there's there is a problem and that there's enough<00:02:05.880><c> of</c><00:02:06.060><c> a</c><00:02:06.240><c> problem</c><00:02:06.360><c> that</c><00:02:06.780><c> people</c><00:02:06.899><c> will</c><00:02:07.140><c> pay</c> enough of a problem that people will pay enough of a problem that people will pay you<00:02:07.439><c> to</c><00:02:07.619><c> solve</c><00:02:07.860><c> it</c> you to solve it you to solve it and<00:02:09.060><c> I</c><00:02:09.239><c> think</c><00:02:09.360><c> this</c><00:02:09.539><c> is</c><00:02:09.660><c> actually</c><00:02:09.899><c> something</c> and I think this is actually something and I think this is actually something that<00:02:10.679><c> people</c><00:02:10.920><c> who</c><00:02:11.160><c> raise</c><00:02:11.340><c> a</c><00:02:11.580><c> bunch</c><00:02:11.700><c> of</c><00:02:11.819><c> money</c> that people who raise a bunch of money that people who raise a bunch of money tend<00:02:12.540><c> to</c><00:02:12.599><c> get</c><00:02:12.720><c> backwards</c><00:02:13.260><c> because</c><00:02:13.819><c> there</c><00:02:14.819><c> is</c> tend to get backwards because there is tend to get backwards because there is this<00:02:15.780><c> idea</c><00:02:16.440><c> that</c> this idea that this idea that I<00:02:18.180><c> will</c><00:02:18.300><c> just</c><00:02:18.540><c> spend</c><00:02:18.959><c> all</c><00:02:19.140><c> of</c><00:02:19.319><c> this</c><00:02:19.440><c> money</c><00:02:19.739><c> to</c> I will just spend all of this money to I will just spend all of this money to create<00:02:21.959><c> as</c><00:02:22.200><c> much</c><00:02:22.379><c> growth</c><00:02:22.739><c> as</c><00:02:22.860><c> possible</c><00:02:23.160><c> and</c> create as much growth as possible and create as much growth as possible and kind<00:02:23.700><c> of</c><00:02:23.819><c> figure</c><00:02:24.239><c> out</c><00:02:24.599><c> the</c><00:02:25.020><c> problem</c><00:02:25.260><c> aspect</c> kind of figure out the problem aspect kind of figure out the problem aspect along<00:02:26.400><c> the</c><00:02:26.700><c> way</c> along the way along the way and<00:02:28.080><c> I</c><00:02:28.200><c> think</c><00:02:28.319><c> that</c><00:02:28.500><c> leads</c><00:02:28.800><c> to</c><00:02:28.920><c> a</c><00:02:29.099><c> lot</c><00:02:29.220><c> of</c> and I think that leads to a lot of and I think that leads to a lot of wasted<00:02:30.480><c> money</c><00:02:30.900><c> in</c><00:02:31.680><c> venture</c><00:02:32.280><c> capital</c><00:02:32.459><c> in</c><00:02:33.360><c> fact</c>
