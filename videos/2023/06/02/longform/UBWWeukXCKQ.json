or</c><00:00:55.079><c> AI</c> it's going to bring forth a Utopia or AI it's going to bring forth a Utopia or AI is<00:00:55.980><c> going</c><00:00:56.160><c> to</c><00:00:56.280><c> be</c><00:00:56.399><c> the</c><00:00:56.579><c> end</c><00:00:56.699><c> of</c><00:00:56.820><c> the</c><00:00:56.940><c> world</c><00:00:57.000><c> and</c> is going to be the end of the world and is going to be the end of the world and we're<00:00:57.480><c> all</c><00:00:57.600><c> going</c><00:00:57.780><c> to</c><00:00:57.960><c> die</c><00:00:58.199><c> right</c><00:00:58.980><c> I</c><00:00:59.699><c> believe</c> we're all going to die right I believe we're all going to die right I believe that<00:01:00.120><c> the</c><00:01:00.300><c> answer</c><00:01:00.420><c> is</c><00:01:00.660><c> somewhere</c><00:01:01.079><c> in</c><00:01:01.320><c> the</c> that the answer is somewhere in the that the answer is somewhere in the middle<00:01:01.559><c> and</c><00:01:02.219><c> so</c><00:01:02.460><c> let's</c><00:01:03.059><c> try</c><00:01:03.420><c> to</c><00:01:03.960><c> figure</c><00:01:04.680><c> out</c> middle and so let's try to figure out middle and so let's try to figure out maybe<00:01:05.159><c> where</c><00:01:05.519><c> that</c><00:01:05.700><c> middle</c><00:01:05.880><c> is</c><00:01:06.180><c> because</c><00:01:06.600><c> I</c> maybe where that middle is because I maybe where that middle is because I think<00:01:07.140><c> it</c><00:01:07.260><c> has</c><00:01:07.439><c> good</c><00:01:07.619><c> parts</c><00:01:07.799><c> it</c><00:01:08.100><c> has</c><00:01:08.280><c> bad</c><00:01:08.460><c> parts</c> think it has good parts it has bad parts think it has good parts it has bad parts but<00:01:09.960><c> let's</c><00:01:10.680><c> start</c><00:01:11.460><c> with</c><00:01:11.939><c> just</c><00:01:12.240><c> the</c><00:01:13.140><c> root</c><00:01:13.979><c> of</c><00:01:14.100><c> it</c> but let's start with just the root of it but let's start with just the root of it if<00:01:15.479><c> you</c><00:01:15.720><c> could</c><00:01:15.960><c> share</c><00:01:16.740><c> your</c><00:01:17.100><c>

so</c><00:08:57.060><c> I</c> it's not going to travel with you so I it's not going to travel with you so I think<00:08:57.300><c> at</c><00:08:57.480><c> some</c><00:08:57.660><c> point</c><00:08:57.839><c> it</c><00:08:58.560><c> ends</c><00:08:59.220><c> up</c><00:08:59.279><c> lacking</c> think at some point it ends up lacking think at some point it ends up lacking

when the person can be ready and that's when the person can be ready to<00:09:02.880><c> take</c><00:09:03.060><c> this</c><00:09:03.300><c> to</c><00:09:03.480><c> the</c><00:09:03.600><c>

constant</c><00:09:05.459><c> progression</c><00:09:06.000><c> that</c><00:09:06.240><c> I</c><00:09:06.360><c> think</c> this constant progression that I think this constant progression that I think is<00:09:06.899><c> super</c><00:09:07.140><c> important</c><00:09:07.620><c> and</c><00:09:07.920><c> when</c><00:09:08.040><c> we</c><00:09:08.220><c> can</c><00:09:08.339><c> like</c> is super

I<00:09:14.940><c> truly</c><00:09:15.300><c> get</c><00:09:15.540><c> that</c><00:09:15.720><c> and</c><00:09:15.839><c> it</c><00:09:16.019><c> makes</c><00:09:16.140><c> a</c><00:09:16.320><c>
