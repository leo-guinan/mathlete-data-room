questions on Twitter and one<00:00:21.960><c> of</c><00:00:22.020><c> my</c><00:00:22.080><c> friends</c><00:00:22.199><c> posted</c><00:00:22.800><c> this</c><00:00:22.920><c> question</c> one of my friends posted this question one of my friends posted this question and and and I<00:00:26.279><c> figured</c><00:00:26.640><c> I</c><00:00:26.880><c> could</c><00:00:27.060><c> go</c><00:00:27.240><c> ahead</c><00:00:27.300><c> and</c><00:00:27.480><c> answer</c> I figured I could go ahead and answer I figured I could go ahead and answer that that that so<00:00:29.699><c> her</c><00:00:30.000><c> question</c><00:00:30.180><c> is</c> so her question is so her question is about<00:00:32.040><c> getting</c><00:00:32.579><c> AI</c><00:00:33.059><c> agents</c><00:00:33.480><c> to</c><00:00:33.719><c> do</c><00:00:33.840><c> research</c> about getting AI agents to do research about getting AI agents to do research and<00:00:35.100><c> when</c><00:00:35.219><c> you</c><00:00:35.340><c> have</c><00:00:35.399><c> a</c><00:00:35.520><c> group</c><00:00:35.640><c> of</c><00:00:35.700><c> AIS</c><00:00:36.059><c> how</c><00:00:36.840><c> to</c> and when you have a group of AIS how to and when you have a group of AIS how to pick<00:00:37.320><c> the</c><00:00:37.500><c> one</c><00:00:37.680><c> who</c><00:00:37.920><c> gets</c><00:00:38.160><c> the</c><00:00:38.280><c> final</c><00:00:38.460><c> say</c> pick the one who gets the final say pick the one who gets the final say and<00:00:40.079><c> so</c><00:00:40.399><c> really</c><00:00:41.399><c> two</c><00:00:41.579><c> different</c><00:00:41.760><c> things</c><00:00:42.000><c> here</c> and so really two different things here and so really two different things here so<00:00:42.540><c> let's</c><00:00:42.660><c> start</c><00:00:42.899><c> with</c><00:00:43.140><c> the</c><00:00:43.320><c> first</c><00:00:43.440><c> one</c><00:00:43.680><c> how</c><00:00:44.100><c> to</c> so let's start with the first one how to so let's start with the first one how to get<00:00:44.520><c> them</c><00:00:44.700><c> to</c><00:00:44.879><c> do</c><00:00:45.059><c> research</c> get them to do research get them to do research so<00:00:47.280><c> to</c><00:00:47.460><c> me</c> so to me so to me the<00:00:48.840><c> idea</c><00:00:49.140><c> of</c><00:00:49.320><c> doing</c><00:00:49.440><c> research</c><00:00:49.800><c> really</c> the idea of doing research really the idea of doing research really depends<00:00:50.399><c> on</c><00:00:50.579><c> what</c><00:00:50.879><c> you're</c><00:00:51.120><c> trying</c><00:00:51.480><c> to</c> depends on what you're trying to depends on what you're trying to accomplish<00:00:53.180><c> there's</c><00:00:54.180><c> different</c><00:00:54.539><c> types</c><00:00:54.840><c> of</c> accomplish there's different types of accomplish there's different types of research<00:00:55.440><c> and</c><00:00:56.039><c> so</c><00:00:56.280><c> I</c><00:00:56.640><c> would</c><00:00:56.760><c> actually</c><00:00:56.940><c> have</c> research and so I would actually have research and so I would actually have very<00:00:57.480><c> specialized</c><00:00:58.820><c> agents</c><00:00:59.820><c> who</c><00:01:00.300><c> can</c> very specialized agents who can very specialized agents who can do<00:01:02.039><c> different</c><00:01:02.280><c> types</c><00:01:02.640><c> of</c><00:01:02.760><c> research</c><00:01:03.120><c> in</c> do different types of research in do different types of research in specific<00:01:03.660><c> ways</c><00:01:04.019><c> so</c><00:01:04.500><c> are</c><00:01:04.799><c> you</c><00:01:04.979><c> looking</c><00:01:05.220><c> to</c> specific ways so are you looking to specific ways so are you looking to compile<00:01:06.840><c> a</c><00:01:07.080><c> bunch</c><00:01:07.200><c> of</c><00:01:07.320><c> data</c><00:01:07.619><c> and</c><00:01:07.979><c> kind</c><00:01:08.159><c> of</c> compile a bunch of data and kind of compile a bunch of data and kind of collect<00:01:08.520><c> it</c><00:01:08.700><c> from</c><00:01:09.119><c> disparate</c><00:01:10.020><c> sources</c><00:01:10.439><c> put</c><00:01:10.860><c> it</c> collect it from disparate sources put it collect it from disparate sources put it into<00:01:11.159><c> a</c><00:01:11.880><c> common</c><00:01:12.060><c> format</c><00:01:12.920><c> and</c><00:01:13.920><c> either</c><00:01:14.220><c> insert</c> into a common format and either insert into a common format and either insert into<00:01:14.760><c> a</c><00:01:15.000><c> database</c><00:01:15.240><c> or</c><00:01:15.479><c> just</c><00:01:15.659><c> like</c><00:01:15.780><c> even</c><00:01:16.020><c> like</c><00:01:16.200><c> a</c> into a database or just like even like a into a database or just like even like a CSV<00:01:16.740><c> file</c><00:01:16.979><c> or</c><00:01:17.159><c> something</c><00:01:17.280><c> that</c><00:01:17.460><c> you</c><00:01:17.580><c> can</c> CSV file or something that you can CSV file or something that you can manually<00:01:17.939><c> insert</c><00:01:18.360><c> that's</c><00:01:19.200><c> one</c><00:01:19.439><c> type</c><00:01:19.619><c> of</c> manually insert that's one type of manually insert that's one type of research<00:01:20.220><c> that</c><00:01:20.580><c> I</c><00:01:20.700><c> think</c><00:01:20.820><c> you</c><00:01:21.060><c> could</c><00:01:21.180><c> have</c> research that I think you could have research that I think you could have agents<00:01:21.780><c> do</c> agents do agents do so<00:01:23.460><c> I'd</c><00:01:23.759><c> segment</c><00:01:24.119><c> that</c><00:01:24.360><c> work</c><00:01:24.540><c> out</c><00:01:25.140><c> but</c><00:01:25.560><c> then</c> so I'd segment that work out but then so I'd segment that work out but then there's<00:01:25.799><c> the</c><00:01:26.100><c> idea</c><00:01:26.460><c> of</c><00:01:27.119><c> conceptual</c><00:01:28.080><c> research</c> there's the idea of conceptual research there's the idea of conceptual research and<00:01:29.100><c> say</c><00:01:29.400><c> okay</c><00:01:29.640><c> here's</c><00:01:30.240><c> an</c><00:01:30.360><c> idea</c><00:01:30.720><c> give</c><00:01:31.320><c> me</c><00:01:31.500><c> a</c> and say okay here's an idea give me a and say okay here's an idea give me a bunch<00:01:31.860><c> of</c><00:01:32.520><c> different</c><00:01:33.060><c> information</c><00:01:33.619><c> different</c> bunch of different information different bunch of different information different sources<00:01:35.340><c> that</c><00:01:35.880><c> talk</c><00:01:36.119><c> about</c><00:01:36.240><c> this</c><00:01:36.540><c> idea</c><00:01:36.840><c> and</c> sources that talk about this idea and sources that talk about this idea and this<00:01:37.860><c> is</c><00:01:37.979><c> something</c><00:01:38.159><c> that</c><00:01:38.400><c> you</c><00:01:38.520><c> could</c><00:01:38.640><c> have</c><00:01:38.820><c> a</c> this is something that you could have a this is something that you could have a little<00:01:39.360><c> more</c><00:01:39.900><c> flexibility</c><00:01:40.560><c> with</c><00:01:40.920><c> perhaps</c><00:01:41.340><c> and</c> little more flexibility with perhaps and little more flexibility with perhaps and have<00:01:42.479><c> it</c><00:01:42.659><c> pull</c><00:01:42.780><c> in</c><00:01:42.960><c> different</c><00:01:43.140><c> sources</c><00:01:43.680><c> and</c> have it pull in different sources and have it pull in different sources and get<00:01:45.119><c> it</c><00:01:45.299><c> to</c> get it to get it to pick<00:01:47.100><c> different</c><00:01:47.340><c> pieces</c><00:01:47.880><c> from</c><00:01:48.780><c> different</c> pick different pieces from different pick different pieces from different

this is something that argues both sides this is something that I<00:02:05.880><c> found</c><00:02:05.939><c> AI</c><00:02:06.360><c> is</c><00:02:06.479><c> to</c><00:02:06.600><c> be</c><00:02:06.719><c> better</c><00:02:06.899><c> than</c><00:02:07.079><c> humans</c> I found AI is to be better than humans I found AI is to be better than humans at<00:02:07.500><c> typically</c><00:02:07.860><c> you</c><00:02:08.459><c> know</c><00:02:08.640><c> essentially</c><00:02:08.880><c> having</c> at typically you know essentially having at typically you know essentially having a<00:02:09.239><c> steel</c><00:02:09.660><c> man</c><00:02:09.899><c> the</c><00:02:10.500><c> opposing</c><00:02:11.280><c> argument</c><00:02:11.580><c> as</c> a steel man the opposing argument as a steel man the opposing argument as well<00:02:12.540><c> as</c><00:02:12.720><c> the</c><00:02:13.260><c> one</c><00:02:13.560><c> that</c><00:02:13.920><c> a</c><00:02:14.400><c> given</c><00:02:14.700><c> Source</c> well as the one that a given Source well as the one that a given Source makes makes makes and<00:02:16.379><c> then</c><00:02:16.620><c> there's</c><00:02:16.800><c> like</c><00:02:16.980><c> a</c><00:02:17.220><c> Time</c> and then there's like a Time and then there's like a Time component<00:02:19.260><c> where</c><00:02:19.620><c> are</c><00:02:19.800><c> you</c><00:02:19.920><c> looking</c><00:02:20.099><c> for</c><00:02:20.459><c> like</c> component where are you looking for like component where are you looking for like Recent<00:02:21.239><c> research</c><00:02:21.660><c> or</c><00:02:22.500><c> are</c><00:02:22.680><c> you</c><00:02:22.860><c> looking</c><00:02:23.040><c> for</c> Recent research or are you looking for Recent research or are you looking for kind<00:02:23.879><c> of</c><00:02:24.000><c> collective</c><00:02:24.540><c> research</c><00:02:25.020><c> throughout</c> kind of collective research throughout kind of collective research throughout history<00:02:26.040><c> and</c><00:02:26.879><c> so</c><00:02:27.180><c> if</c><00:02:27.360><c> you're</c><00:02:27.480><c> doing</c><00:02:27.660><c> collected</c> history and so if you're doing collected history and so if you're doing collected history<00:02:28.379><c> through</c><00:02:28.739><c> time</c><00:02:28.920><c> you're</c><00:02:29.640><c> probably</c> history through time you're probably history through time you're probably better<00:02:30.000><c> off</c><00:02:30.180><c> like</c><00:02:30.480><c> figuring</c><00:02:30.900><c> out</c><00:02:30.959><c> some</c><00:02:31.200><c> sort</c> better off like figuring out some sort better off like figuring out some sort of<00:02:31.500><c> very</c><00:02:31.800><c> specific</c><00:02:32.160><c> data</c><00:02:32.879><c> source</c><00:02:33.180><c> and</c><00:02:33.959><c> having</c> of very specific data source and
