think systems<00:02:39.420><c> I</c><00:02:39.599><c> actually</c><00:02:39.720><c> think</c><00:02:39.959><c> a</c><00:02:40.319><c> set</c><00:02:40.440><c> of</c><00:02:40.620><c> rules</c> systems I actually think a set of rules systems I actually think a set of rules that<00:02:41.160><c> I</c><00:02:41.340><c> can</c><00:02:41.459><c> easily</c><00:02:41.879><c> follow</c> that I can easily follow that I can easily follow to<00:02:43.500><c> where</c><00:02:43.680><c> I</c><00:02:44.519><c> don't</c><00:02:44.640><c> have</c><00:02:44.819><c> to</c><00:02:45.000><c> think</c><00:02:45.239><c> about</c> to where I don't have to think about to where I don't have to think about what<00:02:46.620><c> I'm</c><00:02:46.800><c> doing</c><00:02:47.099><c> all</c><00:02:48.000><c> the</c><00:02:48.120><c> time</c> what I'm doing all the time what I'm doing all the time so<00:02:49.800><c> basically</c><00:02:50.640><c> personally</c><00:02:51.540><c>
