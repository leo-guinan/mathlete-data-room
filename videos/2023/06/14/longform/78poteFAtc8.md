do</c> here's what I've been trying to do here's what I've been trying to do basically<00:01:42.840><c> as</c><00:01:43.380><c> I</c><00:01:43.560><c> scrape</c><00:01:43.799><c> a</c><00:01:43.979><c> web</c><00:01:44.159><c> page</c><00:01:44.400><c> I</c><00:01:45.119><c> want</c> basically as I scrape a web page I want basically as I scrape a web page I want to<00:01:45.780><c> figure</c><00:01:46.259><c> out</c> to figure out to figure out is<00:01:48.119><c> this</c><00:01:48.680><c> a</c><00:01:49.680><c> single</c><00:01:50.280><c>

seems</c><00:01:53.880><c> fairly</c><00:01:54.240><c> straightforward</c> that seems fairly straightforward that seems fairly straightforward doesn't<00:01:55.140><c> it</c> doesn't it doesn't it turns<00:01:56.579><c> out</c><00:01:56.700><c> wasn't</c><00:01:57.479><c> quite</c><00:01:57.840><c> as</c><00:01:58.140><c> easy</c><00:01:58.439><c> as</c><00:01:58.920><c> I</c><00:01:59.100><c> had</c> turns out wasn't quite as easy as I had turns out wasn't quite as easy as I had hoped hoped hoped now<00:02:00.960><c> I</c><00:02:01.320><c> was</c><00:02:01.380><c> able</c><00:02:01.799><c> to</c> now I was able to now I was able to scrape<00:02:03.840><c> a</c><00:02:04.020><c> page</c> scrape a page scrape a page that<00:02:05.759><c> was</c><00:02:06.060><c>

even</c><00:02:14.640><c> scrape</c><00:02:15.599><c> it</c><00:02:15.780><c> and</c> and in fact I could even scrape it and and in fact I could even scrape it and return<00:02:16.319><c> it</c><00:02:16.680><c> in</c><00:02:17.459><c> Json</c><00:02:18.239><c> format</c><00:02:19.260><c> so</c><00:02:19.620><c> that</c><00:02:19.680><c> I'll</c><00:02:19.800><c> be</c> return it in Json format so that I'll be return it in Json format so that I'll be able<00:02:20.040><c> to</c><00:02:20.160><c> actually</c><00:02:20.340><c> ingest</c><00:02:20.819><c> that</c><00:02:21.120><c> into</c> able to actually ingest that into able to actually ingest that into you<00:02:23.099><c> know</c><00:02:23.160><c> a</c><00:02:23.459><c> searchable</c><00:02:23.959><c> database</c><00:02:24.959><c> very</c> you know a searchable database very you know a searchable database very easily<00:02:25.920><c> and</c><00:02:26.340><c> so</c><00:02:26.459><c> that</c><00:02:26.760><c> part</c><00:02:27.000><c> pretty</c><00:02:27.959><c> cool</c> easily and so that part pretty cool easily and so that part pretty cool excited<00:02:29.940><c> by</c><00:02:30.060><c> that</c> excited by that excited by that that<00:02:31.440><c> went</c><00:02:31.680><c> smoothly</c> that went smoothly that went smoothly but<00:02:33.540><c> the</c><00:02:33.780><c> classification</c><00:02:34.440><c> problem</c><00:02:34.980><c> was</c> but the classification problem was but the classification problem was different<00:02:35.819><c> so</c> different so different so first<00:02:39.300><c> of</c><00:02:39.480><c> all</c><00:02:39.599><c> what</c><00:02:40.379><c> I</c><00:02:40.560><c> tried</c><00:02:40.739><c> to</c><00:02:40.860><c> do</c><00:02:41.040><c> is</c> first of all what I tried to do is first of all what I tried to do is throw<00:02:43.319><c> all</c><00:02:43.680><c> of</c><00:02:43.800><c> the</c><00:02:43.920><c> context</c><00:02:44.280><c> of</c><00:02:44.580><c> the</c><00:02:44.760><c> page</c> throw all of the context of the page throw all of the context of the page into<00:02:46.080><c> a</c><00:02:46.319><c> vector</c><00:02:46.620><c> database</c><00:02:46.980><c> and</c><00:02:47.519><c> just</c><00:02:47.700><c> ask</c><00:02:48.120><c> the</c> into a vector database and just ask the into a vector database and just ask the question<00:02:48.540><c> is</c><00:02:49.140><c> this</c><00:02:49.260><c> a</c><00:02:49.440><c> property</c><00:02:49.800><c> listing</c> question is this a property listing question is this a property listing turns<00:02:51.720><c> out</c> turns out turns out that<00:02:52.980><c> didn't</c><00:02:53.099><c> work</c><00:02:53.280><c> so</c><00:02:53.459><c> well</c> that didn't work so well that didn't work so well um<00:02:54.599><c> and</c><00:02:54.780><c> the</c><00:02:54.900><c> reason</c><00:02:55.019><c> for</c><00:02:55.260><c> this</c><00:02:55.379><c> I</c><00:02:55.800><c> think</c><00:02:56.220><c> makes</c> um and the reason for this I think makes um and the reason for this I think makes sense<00:02:57.440><c> it</c><00:02:58.440><c> chunks</c><00:02:59.160><c> up</c><00:02:59.280><c> the</c><00:02:59.519><c> page</c><00:02:59.760><c> into</c><00:03:00.180><c> little</c> sense it chunks up the page into little sense it chunks up the page into little bits<00:03:00.840><c> of</c><00:03:00.959><c> content</c><00:03:01.400><c> and</c><00:03:02.400><c> then</c><00:03:02.640><c> tries</c><00:03:03.420><c> to</c><00:03:03.720><c> match</c> bits of content and then tries to match bits of content and then tries to match the<00:03:04.860><c> chunks</c><00:03:05.580><c> closest</c><00:03:05.819><c> to</c><00:03:06.480><c> that</c><00:03:06.900><c> query</c><00:03:07.500><c> pulls</c> the chunks closest to that query pulls the chunks closest to that query pulls it<00:03:08.459><c> out</c><00:03:08.640><c> and</c><00:03:09.239><c> then</c><00:03:09.420><c> only</c><00:03:09.660><c> adds</c><00:03:10.080><c> that</c><00:03:10.200><c> to</c><00:03:10.440><c> the</c> it out and then only adds that to the it out and then only adds that to the context<00:03:10.980><c> that</c><00:03:11.400><c> you</c><00:03:11.519><c> send</c><00:03:11.640><c> to</c><00:03:11.819><c> the</c><00:03:11.940><c> llm</c> context that you send to the llm context that you send to the llm so<00:03:13.980><c>
