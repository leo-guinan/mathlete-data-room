think the most important things that I think you<00:01:10.320><c> should</c><00:01:10.500><c> look</c><00:01:10.619><c> at</c><00:01:10.799><c> when</c><00:01:11.040><c> deciding</c><00:01:11.460><c> whether</c> you should look at when deciding whether you should look at when deciding whether or<00:01:11.760><c> not</c><00:01:11.820><c> to</c><00:01:12.000><c> join</c><00:01:12.240><c>

is<00:01:14.340><c> collected</c> is collected is collected so<00:01:16.439><c> if</c><00:01:16.619><c> we</c><00:01:16.860><c> look</c><00:01:17.159><c> here</c><00:01:17.580><c> at</c><00:01:17.939><c> the</c><00:01:18.119><c> difference</c> so if we look here at the difference so if we look here at the difference between<00:01:18.780><c> the</c><00:01:19.140><c> data</c><00:01:19.380><c> collected</c><00:01:19.799><c> by</c><00:01:20.220><c> threads</c> between the data collected by threads between the data collected by threads versus<00:01:21.060><c> the</c><00:01:21.360><c> data</c><00:01:21.659><c> collected</c><00:01:22.020><c> by</c><00:01:22.200><c> Twitter</c> versus the data collected by Twitter versus the data collected by Twitter there's<00:01:24.060><c> a</c><00:01:24.360><c> pretty</c><00:01:24.600><c> considerable</c><00:01:25.320><c> increase</c> there's a pretty considerable increase there's a pretty considerable increase in<00:01:26.400><c> the</c><00:01:26.580><c> amount</c><00:01:26.880><c> of</c><00:01:27.000><c> data</c><00:01:27.420><c> that's</c><00:01:27.600><c> being</c> in the amount of data that's being in the amount of data that's being collected<00:01:28.439><c> on</c><00:01:28.619><c> you</c><00:01:28.740><c> between</c><00:01:29.040><c> these</c><00:01:29.460><c> two</c><00:01:29.640><c> apps</c> collected on you between these two apps collected on you between these two apps and<00:01:30.900><c> you</c><00:01:31.140><c> compare</c><00:01:31.380><c> it</c><00:01:31.500><c> to</c><00:01:31.680><c> another</c><00:01:31.860><c> Twitter</c> and you compare it to another Twitter and you compare it to another Twitter competitor<00:01:33.119><c> like</c><00:01:33.299><c> blue</c><00:01:33.540><c> sky</c><00:01:34.100><c> there</c><00:01:35.100><c> is</c><00:01:35.280><c> way</c> competitor like blue sky there is way competitor like blue sky there is way less<00:01:36.119><c> data</c><00:01:36.659><c> collection</c><00:01:37.079><c> happening</c> less data collection happening less data collection happening and<00:01:39.240><c> so</c><00:01:39.420><c> I</c><00:01:39.540><c> think</c><00:01:39.659><c> we</c><00:01:39.840><c> are</c><00:01:39.960><c> going</c><00:01:40.140><c> to</c><00:01:40.259><c> see</c><00:01:40.380><c> a</c> and so I think we are going to see a and so I think we are going to see a bunch<00:01:40.740><c> of</c><00:01:40.860><c> fragmentation</c><00:01:41.520><c> in</c><00:01:42.119><c> these</c><00:01:42.299><c> apps</c> bunch of fragmentation in these apps bunch of fragmentation in these apps based<00:01:43.020><c> on</c><00:01:43.079><c> the</c><00:01:43.259><c> amount</c><00:01:43.500><c> of</c><00:01:43.560><c> data</c><00:01:43.860><c> they</c><00:01:44.040><c> collect</c> based on the amount of data they collect based on the amount of data they collect it's<00:01:45.420><c> a</c><00:01:45.540><c> double-edged</c><00:01:46.020><c> sword</c><00:01:46.259><c> though</c><00:01:46.500><c> because</c> it's a double-edged sword though because it's a double-edged sword though because when<00:01:47.460><c> they</c><00:01:47.640><c> collect</c><00:01:47.880><c> less</c><00:01:48.060><c> data</c><00:01:48.540><c> becomes</c><00:01:49.439><c> less</c> when they collect less data becomes less when they collect less data becomes less personalized<00:01:50.399><c> when</c><00:01:50.640><c> it's</c><00:01:50.820><c> less</c><00:01:51.000><c> personalized</c> personalized when it's less personalized personalized when it's less personalized people<00:01:52.619><c> tend</c><00:01:52.920><c> to</c><00:01:53.100><c> use</c><00:01:53.340><c> it</c><00:01:53.520><c> less</c> people tend to use it less people tend to use it less so so so we'll<00:01:56.340><c> see</c><00:01:56.520><c> how</c><00:01:56.759><c> that</c><00:01:56.939><c> plays</c><00:01:57.360><c> out</c> we'll see how that plays out we'll see how that plays out next<00:01:58.860><c> thing</c><00:01:58.979><c> you</c><00:01:59.159><c> need</c><00:01:59.280><c> to</c><00:01:59.399><c>
