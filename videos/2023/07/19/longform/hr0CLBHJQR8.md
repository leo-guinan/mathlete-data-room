powerful</c><00:01:02.160><c> mechanism</c> it is an incredibly powerful mechanism it is an incredibly powerful mechanism the<00:01:03.899><c> problem</c><00:01:04.140><c> is</c><00:01:04.320><c> I</c><00:01:04.920><c> can't</c><00:01:05.100><c> do</c><00:01:05.460><c> it</c><00:01:05.640><c> at</c><00:01:06.000><c> scale</c> the problem is I can't do it at scale the problem is I can't do it at scale it<00:01:08.400><c> tends</c><00:01:08.700><c> to</c><00:01:08.760><c> be</c><00:01:08.880><c> very</c><00:01:09.119><c> expensive</c><00:01:09.540><c> because</c><00:01:09.840><c> it</c> it tends to be very expensive because it it tends to be very expensive because it is<00:01:10.140><c> time</c><00:01:10.320><c> consuming</c><00:01:10.740><c> on</c><00:01:10.920><c> my</c><00:01:11.100><c> part</c> is time consuming on my part is time consuming on my part and<00:01:12.960><c> so</c><00:01:13.320><c> I'm</c><00:01:13.439><c> not</c><00:01:13.619><c> looking</c><00:01:13.799><c> to</c><00:01:13.979><c> get</c><00:01:14.159><c> a</c><00:01:14.340><c> whole</c> and so I'm not looking to get a whole and so I'm not looking to get a whole

all</c><00:01:18.780><c> of</c> but I do like the idea of taking all of but I do like the idea of taking all of my<00:01:19.080><c> knowledge</c><00:01:19.320><c> and</c><00:01:19.500><c> experience</c><00:01:19.979><c> and</c> my knowledge and experience and my knowledge and experience and Distilling<00:01:21.299><c> it</c><00:01:21.420><c> down</c><00:01:21.600><c>

there</c><00:05:39.360><c> that</c><00:05:39.539><c> maybe</c><00:05:39.720><c> not</c><00:05:40.020><c> as</c><00:05:40.259><c> as</c><00:05:40.680><c> important</c> see there that maybe not as as

chroma just released a new version I started<00:06:28.740><c> poking</c><00:06:29.039><c> out</c><00:06:29.100><c> not</c><00:06:29.340><c> sure</c><00:06:29.520><c> if</c><00:06:29.580><c> I</c><00:06:29.699><c> want</c><00:06:29.759><c> to</c> started poking out not sure if I want to started poking out not sure if I want to include<00:06:30.060><c> that</c><00:06:30.180><c> yet</c><00:06:30.360><c> we'll</c><00:06:30.900><c> see</c><00:06:31.080><c> because</c><00:06:31.259><c> Lang</c> include that yet we'll see because Lang include that yet we'll see because Lang chain<00:06:31.800><c> doesn't</c><00:06:32.039><c> quite</c><00:06:32.280><c> support</c><00:06:32.460><c> it</c><00:06:32.759><c> but</c> chain doesn't quite support it but chain doesn't quite support it but probably<00:06:33.539><c> not</c><00:06:33.720><c> going</c><00:06:33.900><c> to</c><00:06:33.960><c> focus</c><00:06:34.139><c> on</c><00:06:34.319><c> that</c><00:06:34.440><c> for</c> probably not going to focus on that for probably not going to focus on that for this<00:06:34.800><c> piece</c><00:06:35.100><c> anyway</c> this piece anyway this piece anyway um<00:06:36.960><c> okay</c><00:06:37.440><c> cool</c><00:06:37.800><c> and</c><00:06:38.280><c> then</c><00:06:38.460><c> so</c><00:06:39.000><c> based</c><00:06:39.720><c> on</c><00:06:39.780><c> that</c> um okay cool and then so based on that um okay cool and then so based on that I've<00:06:40.199><c> got</c><00:06:40.319><c> to</c><00:06:40.440><c> pick</c><00:06:40.560><c> a</c><00:06:40.680><c> starting</c><00:06:40.800><c> point</c><00:06:41.039><c> for</c> I've got to pick a starting point for I've got to pick a starting point for the<00:06:41.460><c> conversation</c> the conversation the conversation um um um might<00:06:44.819><c> start</c><00:06:45.120><c> with</c><00:06:45.419><c> what</c><00:06:45.660><c> they're</c><00:06:45.780><c> going</c><00:06:45.960><c> to</c> might start with what they're going to might start with what they're going to share<00:06:46.139><c> that</c><00:06:46.319><c> day</c> share that day share that day um<00:06:48.180><c> and</c><00:06:49.080><c> then</c> um and then um and then so<00:06:50.699><c> let's</c><00:06:50.819><c> go</c><00:06:51.000><c> ahead</c><00:06:51.120><c> and</c><00:06:51.180><c> begin</c><00:06:51.419><c> by</c><00:06:51.840><c> kind</c><00:06:52.020><c> of</c> so let's go ahead and begin by kind of so let's go ahead and begin by kind of coming<00:06:52.620><c> up</c><00:06:52.800><c> with</c><00:06:53.160><c> the</c><00:06:53.400><c> system</c><00:06:53.520><c> prompt</c><00:06:54.060><c> here</c> coming up with the system prompt here coming up with the system prompt here and<00:06:55.800><c> so</c><00:06:56.039><c> when</c><00:06:56.520><c> I'm</c><00:06:56.759><c> developing</c><00:06:57.180><c> a</c><00:06:57.360><c> system</c> and so when I'm developing a system and so when I'm developing a system prompt<00:06:58.160><c> I</c><00:06:59.160><c> like</c><00:06:59.400><c> to</c><00:06:59.819><c> give</c><00:07:00.180><c> the</c><00:07:00.840><c> system</c><00:07:01.020><c> an</c> prompt I like to give the system an prompt I like to give the system an identity<00:07:01.860><c> and</c><00:07:02.460><c> so</c><00:07:02.639><c> in</c><00:07:02.819><c> this</c><00:07:02.940><c> case</c><00:07:03.120><c> I'm</c><00:07:03.539><c> going</c> identity and so in this case I'm going identity and so in this case I'm going to<00:07:04.020><c> say</c><00:07:04.259><c> like</c><00:07:04.560><c> you</c><00:07:05.039><c> are</c><00:07:05.220><c> a</c><00:07:05.460><c> building</c><00:07:05.639><c> public</c> to say like you are a building public to say like you are a building public coach<00:07:06.539><c> now</c> the<00:07:10.440><c> AI</c><00:07:10.680><c> may</c><00:07:10.919><c> or</c><00:07:11.039><c> may</c><00:07:11.160><c> not</c><00:07:11.280><c> understand</c><00:07:11.520><c> exactly</c> the AI may or may not understand exactly the AI may or may not understand exactly the<00:07:12.960><c>

that's<00:07:15.300><c> okay</c> that's okay that's okay um<00:07:16.680><c> but</c><00:07:16.919><c> it</c><00:07:17.039><c> kind</c><00:07:17.280><c> of</c><00:07:17.340><c>
