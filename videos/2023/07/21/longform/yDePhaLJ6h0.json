as</c><00:04:31.979><c> we</c><00:04:32.160><c> use</c><00:04:32.340><c> technology</c><00:04:33.259><c> technology</c> that as we use technology technology that as we use technology technology changes<00:04:34.860><c> this</c> changes this changes this um and<00:04:36.060><c> one</c><00:04:36.360><c> of</c><00:04:36.479><c> the</c><00:04:36.540><c> ideas</c><00:04:36.600><c>

this</c><00:04:38.160><c> idea</c><00:04:38.580><c> that</c> exploring lately is this idea that exploring lately is this idea that technology<00:04:40.440><c> is</c><00:04:41.160><c> Humanity's</c><00:04:41.820><c> way</c><00:04:42.000><c> to</c><00:04:42.300><c> choose</c> technology is Humanity's way to choose technology is Humanity's way to choose their<00:04:42.840><c> evolutionary</c><00:04:43.380><c> path</c> their evolutionary path their evolutionary path Choose<00:04:45.780><c> Your</c><00:04:45.840><c> Own</c><00:04:46.020><c> Adventure</c><00:04:46.380><c> style</c> Choose Your Own Adventure style Choose Your Own Adventure style Evolution<00:04:47.300><c> humans</c><00:04:48.300><c> evolved</c><00:04:48.780><c> for</c><00:04:49.020><c> the</c><00:04:49.139><c> sake</c><00:04:49.320><c> of</c> Evolution humans evolved for the sake of Evolution humans evolved for the sake of being<00:04:50.160><c> able</c><00:04:50.340><c> to</c><00:04:50.400><c> evolve</c><00:04:50.820><c> faster</c><00:04:51.000><c> and</c><00:04:51.180><c> faster</c> being able to evolve faster and faster being able to evolve faster and faster but but but we're<00:04:56.040><c> losing</c><00:04:56.460><c> out</c><00:04:56.699><c> on</c><00:04:56.880><c> being</c><00:04:57.120><c> able</c><00:04:57.300><c> to</c><00:04:57.419><c> evolve</c> we're losing out on being able to evolve we're losing out on being able to evolve the<00:04:58.020><c> way</c><00:04:58.199><c> we</c><00:04:58.380><c> want</c><00:04:58.560><c> when</c><00:04:59.520><c> technology</c><00:05:00.240><c> is</c> the way we want when technology is the way we want when technology is affecting<00:05:01.020><c> us</c><00:05:01.340><c> in</c><00:05:02.340><c> very</c><00:05:02.520><c> specific</c><00:05:02.820><c> ways</c> affecting us in very specific ways affecting us in very specific ways and<00:05:04.680><c> so</c><00:05:04.800><c> how</c><00:05:04.979><c> can</c><00:05:05.160><c> we</c><00:05:05.400><c> regain</c><00:05:06.360><c> control</c><00:05:06.660><c> over</c> and so how can we regain control over and so how can we regain control over our<00:05:08.460><c> relationship</c><00:05:08.759><c> with</c><00:05:09.000><c> technology</c><00:05:09.419><c> how</c><00:05:09.960><c> can</c> our relationship with technology how can our relationship with technology how can we<00:05:10.199><c> regain</c><00:05:10.560><c> control</c><00:05:10.860><c> over</c><00:05:11.580><c> our</c><00:05:12.479><c> evolutionary</c> we regain control over our evolutionary we regain control over our evolutionary path I<00:05:16.080><c> don't</c><00:05:16.199><c> have</c><00:05:16.320><c> the</c><00:05:16.440><c> answers</c><00:05:16.680><c> to</c><00:05:16.860><c> that</c><00:05:17.040><c> yet</c> I don't have the answers to that yet I don't have the answers to that yet something<00:05:18.240><c> I'm</c><00:05:18.479><c> working</c><00:05:18.600><c> on</c><00:05:18.840><c> something</c><00:05:19.740><c> I've</c> something I'm working on something I've something I'm working on something I've got<00:05:20.160><c> to</c><00:05:20.280><c> figure</c><00:05:20.400><c> out</c><00:05:20.580><c> personally</c> got to figure out personally got to figure out personally I<00:05:22.740><c> want</c><00:05:22.860><c> to</c><00:05:22.979><c> share</c><00:05:23.100><c> what</c><00:05:23.280><c> I</c><00:05:23.400><c> find</c><00:05:23.520><c> out</c><00:05:23.699><c> so</c><00:05:23.940><c> that</c> I want to share what I find out so that I want to share what I find out so that hopefully<00:05:24.419><c> it'll</c><00:05:24.660><c> help</c><00:05:24.840><c> others</c><00:05:25.199><c> figure</c><00:05:25.860><c> that</c> hopefully it'll help others figure that hopefully it'll help others figure that out<00:05:26.220><c> as</c><00:05:26.400><c> well</c> out as well out as well but but but ultimately<00:05:30.180><c> I</c><00:05:31.080><c> think</c><00:05:31.199><c> just</c><00:05:31.680><c> asking</c><00:05:32.100><c> the</c> ultimately I think just asking the ultimately I think just asking the question<00:05:32.520><c> of</c><00:05:33.180><c> how</c><00:05:33.539><c> art</c><00:05:33.720><c> technology</c><00:05:34.199><c> is</c> question of how art technology is question of how art technology is changing<00:05:34.860><c> us</c><00:05:35.180><c> and</c><00:05:36.180><c> is</c><00:05:36.539><c> that</c><00:05:36.840><c> for</c><00:05:37.620><c> better</c><00:05:37.800><c> or</c> changing us and is that for better or changing us and is that for better or worse worse worse because<00:05:40.259><c> once</c><00:05:40.560><c> we</c><00:05:40.680><c> ask</c><00:05:40.800><c> that</c><00:05:41.039><c> question</c><00:05:41.280><c> and</c><00:05:41.759><c> we</c> because once we ask that question and we because once we ask that question and we have<00:05:42.060><c> that</c><00:05:42.240><c> answer</c> have that answer have that answer we<00:05:44.639><c> then</c><00:05:44.820><c> can</c><00:05:45.600><c> make</c><00:05:45.780><c> choices</c><00:05:46.259><c> to</c><00:05:46.919><c> change</c><00:05:47.160><c> the</c> we then can make choices to change the we then can make choices to change the outcomes outcomes outcomes and<00:05:49.080><c> that</c><00:05:49.199><c> is</c><00:05:49.320><c> the</c><00:05:49.500><c> most</c><00:05:49.620><c>
