this</c><00:30:57.360><c> idea</c><00:30:57.539><c> popping</c><00:30:57.899><c> in</c><00:30:58.020><c> my</c> and so I had this idea popping in my and so I had this idea popping in my head<00:30:58.200><c> today</c><00:30:58.860><c> that</c><00:30:59.279><c> is</c><00:30:59.399><c> something</c><00:30:59.580><c> I've</c><00:30:59.760><c> been</c> head today that is something I've been head today that is something I've been exploring<00:31:00.179><c> too</c><00:31:00.360><c> but</c><00:31:01.020><c> it's</c><00:31:01.200><c> the</c><00:31:01.320><c> idea</c><00:31:01.559><c> that</c> exploring too but it's the idea that exploring too but it's the idea that humans<00:31:02.159><c> have</c><00:31:02.340><c> basically</c><00:31:02.700><c> evolved</c><00:31:03.240><c> to</c><00:31:03.600><c> evolve</c> humans have basically evolved to evolve humans have basically evolved to evolve and<00:31:04.919><c> technology</c><00:31:05.700><c> is</c><00:31:06.360><c> our</c><00:31:06.779><c> Choose</c><00:31:07.200><c> Your</c><00:31:07.320><c> Own</c> and technology is our Choose Your Own and technology is our Choose Your Own Adventure<00:31:08.039><c> form</c><00:31:08.520><c> of</c><00:31:08.760><c> evolution</c><00:31:09.200><c> so</c><00:31:10.200><c> instead</c> Adventure form of evolution so instead Adventure form of evolution so instead of<00:31:10.799><c> relying</c><00:31:11.520><c> on</c><00:31:11.820><c> genes</c><00:31:12.299><c> to</c><00:31:12.539><c> decide</c><00:31:12.840><c> what</c><00:31:13.679><c> moves</c> of relying on genes to decide what moves of relying on genes to decide what moves forward<00:31:14.659><c> uh</c><00:31:15.659><c> we</c><00:31:15.899><c> rely</c><00:31:16.380><c> on</c><00:31:16.679><c> people</c><00:31:16.919><c> that</c> forward uh we rely on people that forward uh we rely on people that actually<00:31:17.460><c> just</c><00:31:17.880><c> like</c><00:31:18.120><c> pick</c><00:31:18.360><c> the</c><00:31:18.539><c> technology</c> actually just like pick the technology actually just like pick the technology that<00:31:19.140><c> moves</c><00:31:19.440><c> things</c><00:31:19.559><c> forward</c><00:31:19.860><c> because</c><00:31:20.279><c> that's</c> that moves things forward because that's that moves things forward because that's a<00:31:20.700><c> lot</c><00:31:20.760><c> faster</c><00:31:21.000><c> than</c><00:31:21.240><c> relying</c><00:31:21.659><c> on</c><00:31:21.779><c> genes</c><00:31:22.140><c> to</c><00:31:22.320><c> go</c> a lot faster than relying on genes to go a lot faster than relying on genes to go through<00:31:22.559><c> generations</c><00:31:22.980><c> and</c><00:31:23.279><c> generations</c> through generations and

that</c><00:34:09.240><c> you</c><00:34:09.419><c> want</c> subtract to get the result that you want subtract to get the result that you want like<00:34:10.379><c> so</c><00:34:10.619><c> in</c><00:34:10.859><c> the</c><00:34:10.980><c> moment</c><00:34:11.159><c> it's</c><00:34:11.399><c> like</c><00:34:11.580><c> you</c> like so in the moment it's like you like so in the moment it's like you taste<00:34:12.060><c> it</c><00:34:12.119><c> you're</c><00:34:12.300><c> like</c><00:34:12.419><c> oh</c><00:34:12.599><c> this</c><00:34:12.899><c> needs</c><00:34:13.200><c> this</c>

of</c><00:34:14.879><c> this</c> or this needs less of this or this needs less of this and<00:34:16.740><c> so</c><00:34:16.919><c> you</c><00:34:17.460><c> get</c><00:34:17.639><c> that</c> and so you get that and so you get that but<00:34:19.440><c> doing</c><00:34:19.619><c> the</c><00:34:19.859><c> work</c><00:34:20.060><c> and</c><00:34:21.060><c> through</c> but doing the work and through
