I</c><00:04:31.259><c> did</c><00:04:31.380><c> modify</c><00:04:31.800><c> that</c><00:04:31.979><c> to</c><00:04:32.160><c> actually</c><00:04:32.280><c> just</c> so I did modify that to actually just so I did modify that to actually just say<00:04:32.759><c> unknown</c><00:04:33.540><c> as</c><00:04:33.960><c> opposed</c><00:04:34.259><c> to</c><00:04:34.320><c> I</c><00:04:34.800><c> don't</c><00:04:34.919><c> know</c> say unknown as opposed to I don't know say unknown as opposed to I don't know slight<00:04:37.020><c> difference</c> slight difference slight difference has<00:04:38.880><c> a</c><00:04:39.060><c> big</c><00:04:39.120><c> difference</c><00:04:39.240><c> on</c><00:04:39.540><c> the</c><00:04:39.660><c> outcome</c> has a big difference on the outcome has a big difference on the outcome so so so from<00:04:43.080><c> there</c><00:04:43.580><c> I</c><00:04:44.580><c> also</c><00:04:44.820><c> added</c><00:04:45.180><c> in</c><00:04:45.360><c> a</c><00:04:45.840><c> piece</c><00:04:46.139><c> that</c> from there I also added in a piece that from there I also added in a piece that can<00:04:46.680><c> look</c><00:04:46.979><c> up</c><00:04:47.220><c> sources</c><00:04:48.199><c> and</c><00:04:49.199><c> so</c> can look up sources and so can look up sources and so I<00:04:50.460><c> have</c><00:04:50.639><c>
