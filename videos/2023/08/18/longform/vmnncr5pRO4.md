very</c><00:06:14.880><c> successful</c> they become very successful they become very successful and<00:06:17.820><c> then</c><00:06:18.060><c> the</c><00:06:18.300><c> copycats</c><00:06:18.840><c> start</c><00:06:18.960><c> and</c><00:06:19.440><c> so</c> and then the copycats start and so and then the copycats start and so people<00:06:19.800><c> see</c><00:06:20.100><c> what</c><00:06:20.340><c> worked</c><00:06:20.699><c> and</c><00:06:21.060><c> they</c><00:06:21.240><c> try</c><00:06:21.360><c> to</c> people see what worked and they try to people see what worked and they try to copy<00:06:21.840><c> that</c> and<00:06:25.319><c> then</c><00:06:25.440><c> there</c><00:06:25.620><c> becomes</c><00:06:26.160><c> a</c><00:06:26.880><c> flood</c><00:06:27.539><c>

these</c><00:06:38.340><c> AI</c> like thread boys and you know these AI like thread boys and you know these AI newsletters<00:06:39.720><c> that</c><00:06:40.560><c> you</c><00:06:41.100><c> know</c><00:06:41.220><c> proliferate</c> newsletters that you know proliferate newsletters that you know proliferate because<00:06:42.180><c> people</c><00:06:42.720><c> are</c><00:06:42.960><c> following</c><00:06:43.380><c> patterns</c> because people are following patterns because people are following patterns and<00:06:44.039><c> so</c><00:06:44.160><c> the</c><00:06:44.340><c> more</c><00:06:44.520><c> successful</c><00:06:44.880><c> this</c><00:06:45.060><c> pattern</c> and so the more successful this pattern and so the more successful this pattern has<00:06:45.479><c> been</c><00:06:45.660><c> the</c><00:06:46.380><c> more</c><00:06:46.500><c> people</c><00:06:46.740><c> duplicate</c><00:06:47.280><c> it</c> has been the more people duplicate it has been the more
