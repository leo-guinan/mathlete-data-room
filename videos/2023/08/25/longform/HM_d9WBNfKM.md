that<00:02:50.879><c> there's</c><00:02:51.300><c> a</c><00:02:51.660><c> lack</c><00:02:51.840><c> of</c><00:02:51.959><c> transparency</c> that there's a lack of transparency that there's a lack of transparency first<00:02:52.800><c> of</c><00:02:52.980><c> all</c><00:02:53.040><c> most</c><00:02:53.220><c> people</c><00:02:53.340><c> don't</c><00:02:53.519><c> know</c><00:02:53.640><c> how</c>

it's</c><00:02:55.319><c> not</c> affiliate programs work because it's not affiliate programs work because it's not something<00:02:55.620><c> they've</c><00:02:56.040><c> ever</c><00:02:56.220><c> thought</c><00:02:56.459><c> about</c> something they've ever thought about something they've ever thought about and<00:02:59.220><c> so</c><00:02:59.580><c> there's</c><00:03:00.360><c> this</c><00:03:00.720><c> really</c><00:03:00.959><c> weird</c> and so there's this really weird and so there's this really weird disconnect<00:03:01.739><c> between</c><00:03:02.519><c>
