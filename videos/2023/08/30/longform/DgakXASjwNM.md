at it but look at it now<00:01:16.920><c> I</c><00:01:17.340><c> think</c><00:01:17.460><c> this</c><00:01:17.640><c> is</c><00:01:17.700><c> a</c><00:01:17.880><c> terrible</c><00:01:18.119><c> way</c><00:01:18.360><c> if</c> now I think this is a terrible way if now I think this is a terrible way if you're<00:01:18.780><c> building</c><00:01:18.960><c> a</c><00:01:19.200><c> product</c><00:01:19.380><c> to</c><00:01:19.799><c> get</c> you're building a product to get you're building a product to get someone's<00:01:20.220><c> attention</c> someone's attention someone's attention you<00:01:22.439><c> can</c><00:01:22.560><c> use</c><00:01:22.979><c> it</c><00:01:23.159><c> pretty</c><00:01:23.280><c> effectively</c><00:01:23.820><c> to</c> you can use it pretty effectively to you can use it pretty effectively to grow<00:01:24.180><c> an</c><00:01:24.420><c> audience</c><00:01:24.780><c> but</c> grow an audience but grow an audience but nobody<00:01:27.479><c> wants</c><00:01:27.840><c> to</c><00:01:27.900><c> look</c><00:01:28.020><c> at</c><00:01:28.200><c> train</c><00:01:28.320><c> wrecks</c><00:01:28.740><c> all</c> nobody wants to look at train wrecks all nobody wants to look at train wrecks all the<00:01:29.220><c> time</c><00:01:29.400><c> it's</c><00:01:30.119><c> really</c><00:01:30.299><c> easy</c><00:01:30.479><c> to</c><00:01:30.659><c> catch</c> the time it's really easy to catch the time it's really easy to catch someone's<00:01:31.080><c> attention</c><00:01:31.380><c> but</c><00:01:32.280><c> it's</c><00:01:32.820><c> not</c> someone's attention but it's not someone's attention but it's not attention<00:01:33.960><c> that</c><00:01:34.439><c> you</c><00:01:34.740><c> can</c><00:01:35.000><c> really</c><00:01:36.000><c> keep</c><00:01:36.360><c> too</c> attention that you can really keep too attention that you can really keep too easily<00:01:37.380><c> so</c><00:01:38.100><c> I</c><00:01:38.400><c> don't</c><00:01:38.460><c> recommend</c><00:01:38.820><c> the</c><00:01:39.000><c> train</c> easily so I don't recommend the train easily so I don't recommend the train wreck wreck wreck but but but there<00:01:43.500><c> is</c><00:01:43.740><c> another</c><00:01:44.460><c> approach</c><00:01:45.420><c> you</c><00:01:45.600><c> can</c><00:01:45.840><c> do</c> there is another approach you can do there is another approach you can do and<00:01:47.460><c> this</c><00:01:47.640><c> is</c><00:01:47.820><c> something</c><00:01:48.200><c> that</c><00:01:49.200><c> it</c><00:01:49.979><c> just</c><00:01:50.159><c> has</c> and this is something that it just has and this is something that it just has to<00:01:50.579><c> be</c> speaking<00:01:54.000><c> enough</c> speaking enough speaking enough to<00:01:56.040><c> the</c><00:01:56.399><c> person</c><00:01:56.579><c> who's</c><00:01:56.880><c> scrolling</c> to the person who's scrolling to the person who's scrolling and<00:01:58.740><c> so</c><00:01:59.100><c> the</c><00:01:59.700><c> important</c><00:02:00.000><c> thing</c><00:02:00.119><c> here</c><00:02:00.360><c> is</c><00:02:00.600><c> to</c> and so the important thing here is to and so the important thing here is to understand understand understand whose<00:02:03.360><c> attention</c><00:02:03.840><c> you</c><00:02:04.380><c> want</c><00:02:04.500><c> to</c><00:02:04.799><c> get</c> whose attention you want to get whose attention you want to get

of</c><00:02:08.940><c> the</c><00:02:09.660><c> key</c><00:02:10.319><c> things</c><00:02:10.500><c> we've</c><00:02:10.679><c> been</c><00:02:10.800><c> working</c> one of the key things we've been working one of the key things we've been working on<00:02:11.280><c> is</c><00:02:11.640><c> the</c><00:02:11.819><c> idea</c><00:02:12.060><c> of</c><00:02:12.360><c> a</c><00:02:12.540><c> launch</c> on is the idea of a launch on is the idea of a launch and<00:02:14.400><c> what</c><00:02:14.760><c> does</c><00:02:14.879><c> a</c><00:02:15.000><c> launch</c><00:02:15.239><c> look</c><00:02:15.599><c> like</c><00:02:15.780><c> and</c><00:02:16.319><c> how</c> and what does a launch look like and how and what does a launch look like and how often<00:02:16.800><c>

for</c><00:02:22.260><c> a</c> constantly and this is important for a constantly and this is important for a couple<00:02:22.500><c> different</c><00:02:22.739><c> reasons</c><00:02:23.160><c> first</c><00:02:23.640><c> of</c><00:02:23.819><c> all</c> couple different reasons first of all couple different reasons first of all every<00:02:25.140><c> individual</c><00:02:25.560><c> launch</c> every individual launch every individual launch isn't<00:02:27.239><c> really</c><00:02:27.300><c> going</c><00:02:27.480><c> to</c><00:02:27.599><c> matter</c><00:02:27.720><c>
