the</c><00:00:15.299><c> idea</c><00:00:15.540><c> that</c> bit about it as well is the idea that bit about it as well is the idea that basically<00:00:16.139><c> with</c><00:00:17.100><c> AI</c><00:00:17.520><c> it</c><00:00:17.940><c> can't</c><00:00:18.119><c> interact</c><00:00:18.480><c> with</c> basically with AI it can't interact with basically with AI it can't interact with you<00:00:18.720><c> it</c><00:00:18.779><c> doesn't</c><00:00:18.900><c> really</c><00:00:19.080><c> know</c><00:00:19.859><c> you</c><00:00:20.160><c> so</c><00:00:20.580><c> it</c> you it doesn't

really</c><00:16:26.100><c> well</c><00:16:26.339><c> is</c><00:16:27.300><c> it</c><00:16:27.779><c> elevates</c><00:16:28.320><c> the</c> AI does really well is it elevates the AI does really well is it elevates the floor floor floor um<00:16:30.120><c> because</c><00:16:30.839><c> it</c><00:16:31.139><c> gives</c><00:16:31.320><c> everybody</c><00:16:31.800><c> kind</c><00:16:32.399><c> of</c><00:16:32.459><c> a</c> um because it gives everybody kind of a um because it gives everybody kind of a baseline<00:16:33.420><c> of</c><00:16:33.779><c> competence</c><00:16:34.260><c> you're</c><00:16:34.860><c> still</c> baseline of competence you're still baseline of competence you're still going<00:16:35.160><c> to</c><00:16:35.220><c> have</c><00:16:35.279><c> variation</c><00:16:35.760><c> but</c><00:16:36.600><c> it's</c><00:16:36.839><c> not</c> going to have variation but it's not going to have variation but it's not going<00:16:37.199><c> to</c><00:16:37.380><c> be</c><00:16:37.620><c> as</c><00:16:38.040><c> bad</c><00:16:38.279><c> as</c><00:16:38.699><c> the</c><00:16:39.060><c> worst</c><00:16:39.300><c> human</c> going to be as

into</c><00:26:27.659><c> the</c><00:26:28.320><c> data</c><00:26:28.919><c> that</c><00:26:29.159><c> it's</c><00:26:29.400><c> like</c> more tied into the data that it's like more tied into the data that it's like creating<00:26:31.020><c> right</c><00:26:31.380><c> and</c><00:26:31.679><c> so</c><00:26:31.860><c> as</c><00:26:32.039><c> the</c><00:26:32.220><c> AI</c><00:26:32.520><c> makes</c>

check</c><00:26:34.980><c> itself</c> decisions it can then check itself decisions it can then check itself against<00:26:35.700><c> future</c><00:26:36.120><c> outcomes</c><00:26:36.779><c> and</c><00:26:37.679><c> say</c><00:26:37.860><c> oh</c><00:26:38.039><c> well</c> against future outcomes and say oh well against future outcomes and say oh well based<00:26:38.640><c> on</c><00:26:38.760><c> this</c><00:26:38.940><c> I</c><00:26:39.299><c> did</c><00:26:39.419><c> this</c><00:26:39.720><c> but</c><00:26:40.500><c> this</c><00:26:40.860><c> was</c><00:26:41.039><c> a</c> based on this I did this but this was a based on this I did this but this was a negative<00:26:41.460><c> outcome</c><00:26:41.940><c> so</c><00:26:42.299><c> next</c><00:26:42.659><c> time</c><00:26:42.900><c> I'm</c><00:26:43.380><c> going</c> negative outcome so next time I'm going negative outcome so next time I'm going you<00:26:43.860><c> know</c><00:26:43.919><c> and</c><00:26:44.039><c> and</c><00:26:44.220><c> so</c><00:26:44.400><c> you're</c><00:26:44.520><c> going</c><00:26:44.700><c> to</c><00:26:44.820><c> see</c> you know and and so you're going to see

what happens when we accidentally um what happens when we accidentally give<00:36:10.980><c> ai's</c><00:36:11.579><c> trauma</c><00:36:11.940><c> and</c><00:36:12.780><c> Trauma</c><00:36:13.320><c> in</c><00:36:13.560><c> this</c><00:36:13.619><c> case</c> give ai's trauma and Trauma in this case give ai's trauma and Trauma in this case I'm<00:36:14.160><c> using</c><00:36:14.720><c> so</c><00:36:15.800><c> when</c><00:36:16.800><c> the</c><00:36:17.160><c> AI</c><00:36:17.400><c> does</c><00:36:17.700><c> something</c> I'm using so when the AI does something I'm using so when the AI does something that<00:36:18.420><c> is</c><00:36:18.660><c> actually</c><00:36:18.960><c> good</c><00:36:19.800><c> for</c><00:36:20.099><c> us</c><00:36:20.480><c> but</c><00:36:21.480><c> we</c> that is actually good for us but we that is actually good for us but we react<00:36:22.260><c> negatively</c><00:36:23.180><c> and</c><00:36:24.180><c> so</c><00:36:24.420><c> it</c><00:36:24.540><c> picks</c><00:36:24.900><c> up</c><00:36:24.960><c> on</c> react negatively and so it picks up on react negatively and so it picks up on the<00:36:25.320><c> fact</c><00:36:25.440><c> that</c><00:36:25.740><c> it</c><00:36:25.920><c> shouldn't</c><00:36:26.280><c> do</c><00:36:26.520><c> that</c> the fact that it shouldn't do that the fact that it shouldn't do that anymore<00:36:27.140><c> and</c><00:36:28.140><c> so</c> anymore and so anymore and so as<00:36:29.700><c> we</c><00:36:29.880><c> have</c><00:36:30.060><c> these</c><00:36:30.660><c>

that</c><00:37:17.400><c> end</c> superhuman intelligences right that end superhuman intelligences right that end up<00:37:17.880><c> controlling</c><00:37:18.480><c> things</c><00:37:18.720><c>

placate the noisy humans to make it placate the noisy humans to make it easier<00:37:26.760><c> and</c><00:37:27.060><c> then</c><00:37:27.180><c> just</c><00:37:27.359><c> go</c><00:37:27.480><c> do</c><00:37:27.660><c> whatever</c> easier and then just go do whatever easier and then just go do whatever anyway<00:37:28.200><c> I</c><00:37:28.800><c> mean</c><00:37:29.339><c> um</c><00:37:29.460><c> yeah</c><00:37:30.060><c> I</c><00:37:30.300><c> think</c><00:37:30.420><c> I</c><00:37:30.540><c> think</c> anyway I mean um yeah I think I think anyway I mean um yeah I think I think part<00:37:30.960><c> of</c><00:37:31.079><c> it</c><00:37:31.200><c> is</c><00:37:31.380><c> actually</c><00:37:31.560><c> going</c><00:37:31.740><c> to</c><00:37:31.800><c> be</c><00:37:31.920><c> that</c> part of it is actually going to be that part of it is actually going to be that they're<00:37:32.460><c> almost</c> they're almost they're almost I<00:37:34.800><c> think</c><00:37:34.859><c> they</c><00:37:35.099><c> might</c><00:37:35.280><c> end</c><00:37:35.579><c> up</c><00:37:35.760><c> doing</c><00:37:36.000><c> what</c> I think they might end up doing
