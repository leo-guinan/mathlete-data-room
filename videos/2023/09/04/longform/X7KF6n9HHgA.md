we'll see how this goes plans for that we'll see how this goes but<00:04:03.900><c> for</c><00:04:04.799><c> the</c><00:04:04.920><c> most</c><00:04:05.040><c> part</c> but for the most part but for the most part not<00:04:06.480><c> a</c><00:04:06.599><c> lot</c><00:04:06.720><c> of</c><00:04:06.780><c> direct-to-consumer</c><00:04:07.440><c> stuff</c> not a lot of direct-to-consumer stuff not a lot of direct-to-consumer stuff so<00:04:08.760><c> how</c><00:04:08.940><c> do</c><00:04:09.120><c> some</c><00:04:09.239><c> of</c><00:04:09.360><c> these</c><00:04:09.540><c> principles</c> so how do some of these principles so how do some of these principles appear<00:04:11.700><c> in</c><00:04:12.000><c> the</c><00:04:12.120><c> direct</c><00:04:12.180><c> consumer</c><00:04:12.840><c> Market</c> appear in the direct consumer Market appear in the direct consumer Market and<00:04:14.700><c> how</c><00:04:15.239><c> can</c><00:04:15.420><c> we</c><00:04:15.540><c> translate</c><00:04:15.780><c> those</c><00:04:16.380><c> into</c><00:04:16.919><c> SAS</c> and how can we translate those into SAS and how can we translate those into SAS I'd<00:04:18.359><c> say</c><00:04:18.600><c> there's</c><00:04:18.720><c> two</c><00:04:18.959><c> ways</c><00:04:19.199><c> from</c><00:04:19.320><c> the</c><00:04:19.440><c> direct</c> I'd say there's two ways from the direct I'd say there's two ways from the direct consumer<00:04:20.040><c> and</c><00:04:20.160><c> then</c><00:04:20.340><c> how</c><00:04:20.639><c> they</c><00:04:20.820><c> translate</c> consumer and then how they translate consumer and then how they translate into<00:04:21.419><c> SAS</c><00:04:21.900><c> so</c><00:04:22.800><c> first</c><00:04:23.160><c> off</c><00:04:23.400><c> with</c><00:04:23.699><c> direct</c> into SAS so first off with direct into SAS so first off with direct consumer<00:04:24.419><c> started</c><00:04:24.720><c> out</c><00:04:24.840><c> with</c><00:04:24.960><c> you</c><00:04:25.080><c> know</c><00:04:25.199><c> we're</c> consumer started out with you know we're consumer started out with you know we're more<00:04:25.680><c> sustainable</c><00:04:26.220><c> we're</c><00:04:26.759><c> faster</c><00:04:27.120><c> it's</c> more sustainable we're faster it's more sustainable we're faster it's online<00:04:27.840><c> you</c><00:04:28.440><c> can</c><00:04:28.620><c> see</c><00:04:28.800><c> everything</c><00:04:29.040><c> and</c><00:04:29.699><c> that</c> online you can see everything and that online you can see everything and that really<00:04:30.060><c> really</c><00:04:30.180><c> set</c><00:04:30.479><c> them</c><00:04:30.660><c> apart</c><00:04:30.840><c> is</c><00:04:31.080><c> very</c> really really set them apart is very really really set them apart is very same<00:04:31.620><c> and</c><00:04:31.979><c> then</c><00:04:32.100><c> the</c><00:04:32.580><c> second</c><00:04:32.699><c> wave</c><00:04:33.120><c> came</c><00:04:33.720><c> with</c> same and then the second wave came with same and then the second wave came with you<00:04:34.800><c> know</c><00:04:34.860><c> there's</c><00:04:35.040><c> so</c><00:04:35.280><c> much</c><00:04:35.400><c> more</c> you know there's so much more you know there's so much more competition<00:04:36.000><c> in</c><00:04:36.300><c> the</c><00:04:36.419><c> space</c><00:04:36.600><c> so</c><00:04:36.780><c> how</c><00:04:36.960><c> do</c><00:04:37.080><c> we</c> competition in the space so how do we competition in the space so
