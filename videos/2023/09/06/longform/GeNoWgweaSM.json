simply</c><00:03:51.379><c> tracking</c><00:03:52.379><c> this</c> and I think simply tracking this and I think simply tracking this information<00:03:53.239><c> over</c><00:03:54.239><c> time</c><00:03:54.599><c> is</c><00:03:55.019><c> a</c><00:03:55.200><c> great</c><00:03:55.319><c> way</c><00:03:55.560><c> to</c> information over time is a great way to information over time is a great way to do<00:03:55.920><c> that</c><00:03:56.099><c> it's</c><00:03:56.760><c> why</c><00:03:57.000><c> journaling</c><00:03:57.480><c> can</c><00:03:57.659><c> be</c><00:03:57.840><c> so</c> do that it's why journaling can be so do that it's why journaling can be so effective effective effective but<00:03:59.400><c> it's</c><00:03:59.519><c> hard</c><00:03:59.700><c> to</c><00:03:59.819><c> build</c><00:03:59.940><c> a</c><00:04:00.120><c> journaling</c> but it's hard to build a journaling but it's hard to build a journaling practice practice practice and<00:04:01.980><c> I</c><00:04:02.099><c> know</c><00:04:02.340><c> I've</c><00:04:02.760><c> tried</c><00:04:03.000><c> this</c><00:04:03.360><c> multiple</c> and I know I've tried this multiple and I know I've tried this multiple times<00:04:04.080><c> and</c><00:04:04.620><c> so</c><00:04:04.860><c> the</c><00:04:05.099><c> goal</c><00:04:05.400><c> here</c><00:04:05.519><c> is</c><00:04:05.700><c> to</c><00:04:05.940><c> make</c><00:04:06.120><c> it</c> times and so the goal here is to make it times and so the goal here is to make it as<00:04:06.540><c> low</c><00:04:06.840><c> friction</c> as low friction as low friction easy<00:04:08.879><c> to</c><00:04:09.239><c> start</c><00:04:09.540><c> as</c><00:04:10.080><c> possible</c> easy to start as possible easy to start as possible and<00:04:11.879><c> I</c><00:04:12.299><c> do</c><00:04:12.480><c> that</c><00:04:12.720><c> with</c><00:04:13.379><c> a</c><00:04:13.500><c> daily</c><00:04:13.680><c> email</c> and I do that with a
