back</c><00:01:17.580><c> to</c> know this and it would send that back to know this and it would send that back to the<00:01:17.760><c> user</c><00:01:18.000><c> because</c><00:01:18.060><c> that</c><00:01:18.299><c> was</c><00:01:18.420><c> all</c><00:01:18.540><c> it</c><00:01:18.659><c> was</c> the user because that was all it was the user because that was all it was just<00:01:19.200><c> there</c><00:01:19.500><c> were</c><00:01:19.619><c> no</c><00:01:19.680><c> more</c><00:01:19.860><c> steps</c> just there were no more steps just there were no more steps

about how so instead I started thinking about how we<00:01:25.560><c> actually</c><00:01:25.799><c> have</c><00:01:25.979><c> conversations</c><00:01:26.400><c> with</c> we actually have conversations with we actually have conversations with other<00:01:27.000><c> people</c><00:01:27.299><c> and</c><00:01:28.020><c> what</c><00:01:28.259><c> does</c><00:01:28.380><c> that</c><00:01:28.500><c>

this first example we can see and in this first example we can see that that that it<00:03:17.580><c> was</c><00:03:18.000><c> like</c><00:03:18.239><c> yeah</c><00:03:18.420><c> I'll</c><00:03:18.599><c> be</c><00:03:18.780><c> helpful</c><00:03:19.080><c> but</c><00:03:19.319><c> I</c> it was like yeah I'll be helpful but I it was like yeah I'll be helpful but I

it</c><00:03:32.760><c> was</c><00:03:32.940><c> able</c><00:03:33.120><c> to</c><00:03:33.239><c> figure</c><00:03:33.659><c> out</c> what we see is it was able to figure out what we see is it was able to figure out exactly<00:03:34.700><c> what</c><00:03:35.700><c> was</c><00:03:35.879><c> going</c><00:03:36.000><c> on</c><00:03:36.120><c> it</c><00:03:36.420><c> was</c><00:03:36.540><c> able</c><00:03:36.780><c> to</c> exactly what was going on it was able to exactly what was going on it was able to give<00:03:37.080><c> a</c><00:03:37.620><c> much</c><00:03:37.800><c> better</c><00:03:38.159><c> answer</c><00:03:38.700><c> and</c><00:03:39.599><c> for</c><00:03:39.720><c> me</c> give a much better answer and for me give a much better answer and for me this<00:03:40.200><c> is</c><00:03:40.319><c> a</c><00:03:40.560><c> huge</c><00:03:40.920><c> quality</c><00:03:41.340><c> gain</c> this is a huge quality gain this is a huge quality gain and<00:03:43.739><c> it's</c><00:03:44.400><c> also</c> and it's also and it's also simpler<00:03:46.440><c> in</c><00:03:46.560><c> the</c><00:03:46.739><c> code</c><00:03:46.860><c> honestly</c><00:03:47.400><c> like</c> simpler in the code honestly like simpler in the code honestly like instead<00:03:48.480><c> of</c><00:03:49.080><c> having</c><00:03:49.620><c> this</c><00:03:50.040><c> kind</c><00:03:50.519><c> of</c> instead of having this kind of instead of having this kind of convoluted<00:03:51.120><c> tools</c><00:03:51.720><c> that</c><00:03:52.080><c> I</c><00:03:52.319><c> go</c><00:03:52.620><c> and</c><00:03:52.799><c> access</c> convoluted tools that I go and access convoluted tools that I go and access and<00:03:53.580><c> pull</c><00:03:53.819><c> in</c> and pull in and pull in um<00:03:55.560><c> now</c><00:03:56.220><c> actually</c><00:03:56.760><c> have</c><00:03:57.420><c> my</c><00:03:57.959><c> class</c><00:03:58.739><c> that</c><00:03:59.040><c> kind</c> um now actually have my class that kind um now actually have my class that kind of<00:03:59.340><c> contains</c><00:03:59.700><c> all</c><00:03:59.879><c> of</c><00:04:00.000><c> it</c><00:04:00.120><c> and</c><00:04:00.720><c> I</c><00:04:00.900><c> have</c><00:04:01.019><c> a</c> of contains all of it and I have a of contains all of it and I have a method<00:04:01.440><c> that</c><00:04:01.799><c> respond</c><00:04:02.220><c> to</c><00:04:02.459><c> message</c><00:04:02.840><c> and</c> method that respond to message and method that respond to message and within<00:04:04.260><c> that</c><00:04:04.440><c> it</c><00:04:04.680><c> caused</c><00:04:05.099><c> an</c><00:04:05.220><c> internal</c> within that it caused an internal within that it caused an internal thinking<00:04:06.120><c> process</c><00:04:07.080><c> which</c><00:04:07.920><c> figures</c><00:04:08.280><c> out</c><00:04:08.400><c> what</c> thinking process which figures out what thinking process which figures out what it<00:04:08.640><c> needs</c><00:04:08.819><c> to</c><00:04:08.879><c> do</c><00:04:09.000><c> and</c><00:04:09.420><c> then</c><00:04:09.599><c> it</c><00:04:09.900><c> figures</c><00:04:10.200><c> out</c> it needs to do and then it figures out it needs to do and then it figures out how<00:04:10.560><c> to</c><00:04:10.680><c> respond</c><00:04:10.980><c> then</c><00:04:11.159><c> it</c><00:04:11.340><c> responds</c><00:04:12.239><c> and</c><00:04:12.780><c> from</c> how to respond then it responds and from how to respond then it responds and from that<00:04:13.080><c> standpoint</c><00:04:13.500><c> it's</c><00:04:14.220><c> just</c><00:04:14.519><c> it's</c><00:04:15.000><c> much</c> that standpoint it's just it's much that standpoint it's just it's much easier<00:04:15.659><c> to</c><00:04:15.840><c> deal</c><00:04:16.019><c> with</c><00:04:16.260><c> and</c><00:04:16.560><c> I</c><00:04:16.739><c> can</c><00:04:16.919><c> do</c><00:04:17.040><c> some</c> easier to deal with and I can do some easier to deal with and I can do some tinkering<00:04:17.760><c> kind</c><00:04:18.000><c> of</c><00:04:18.120><c> within</c><00:04:18.840><c> that</c><00:04:18.959><c> to</c><00:04:19.199><c> get</c> tinkering kind of within that

know</c><00:04:22.620><c> add</c><00:04:23.040><c> in</c> better results and I can you know add in better results and I can you know add in different<00:04:23.400><c> things</c><00:04:23.580><c> and</c><00:04:23.820><c> honestly</c><00:04:24.120><c> I've</c><00:04:24.240><c> been</c> different things and honestly I've been different things and honestly I've been thinking<00:04:24.540><c> about</c><00:04:24.660><c> adding</c><00:04:25.020><c> in</c><00:04:25.199><c> different</c> thinking about adding in different thinking about adding in different agents<00:04:26.580><c> that</c><00:04:26.759><c> can</c><00:04:26.940><c> interact</c><00:04:27.240><c> and</c><00:04:27.419><c> actually</c> agents that can interact and actually agents that can interact and actually have<00:04:27.840><c> their</c><00:04:28.080><c> own</c><00:04:28.199><c> conversation</c><00:04:28.740><c> histories</c> have their own conversation histories have their own conversation histories between<00:04:29.460><c> agents</c><00:04:30.000><c> but</c><00:04:30.900><c> that's</c><00:04:31.680><c> a</c><00:04:31.860><c> video</c><00:04:31.979><c> for</c> between agents but that's a video for between agents but that's a video for another<00:04:32.400><c> day</c><00:04:32.699><c> maybe</c><00:04:33.479><c> next</c><00:04:33.780><c> week</c> another day maybe next week another day maybe next week we'll<00:04:35.820><c> see</c><00:04:36.419><c> but</c> we'll see but we'll see but um um um yeah<00:04:39.960><c> I</c><00:04:40.259><c> think</c><00:04:40.440><c> there's</c><00:04:40.919><c> a</c><00:04:41.220><c> lot</c><00:04:41.340><c> that</c><00:04:41.520><c> we</c><00:04:41.639><c> can</c> yeah I think there's a lot that we can yeah I think there's a lot that we can do<00:04:41.880><c> in</c><00:04:42.180><c> exploring</c><00:04:42.600><c> the</c><00:04:42.780><c> way</c><00:04:43.020><c> that</c><00:04:43.320><c> our</c><00:04:43.620><c> brains</c> do in exploring the way that our brains do in exploring the way that our brains actually<00:04:44.160><c> process</c><00:04:45.120><c> information</c><00:04:45.680><c> and</c><00:04:46.680><c> we</c><00:04:47.220><c> have</c> actually process information and we have actually process information and we have this<00:04:47.580><c> difference</c><00:04:47.759><c> between</c><00:04:48.120><c> the</c><00:04:48.419><c> internal</c> this difference between the internal this difference between the internal memory<00:04:49.020><c> the</c><00:04:49.199><c> external</c><00:04:49.620><c> memory</c><00:04:49.919><c> and</c> memory the external memory and memory the external memory and um<00:04:51.660><c> yeah</c><00:04:51.900><c> that</c><00:04:52.139><c> was</c><00:04:52.259><c> actually</c><00:04:52.440><c> a</c><00:04:52.860><c> really</c><00:04:53.040><c> great</c> um yeah that was actually a really great um yeah that was actually a really great guiding<00:04:54.720><c> thought</c><00:04:55.020><c> as</c><00:04:55.500><c> to</c> guiding thought as to guiding thought as to how<00:04:56.940><c> to</c><00:04:57.120><c> make</c><00:04:57.320><c> this</c><00:04:58.320><c> AI</c><00:04:58.800><c> much</c><00:04:59.280><c> more</c> how to make this AI much more how to make this AI much more performance<00:05:00.000><c> so</c><00:05:00.300><c> I</c><00:05:00.960><c> thought</c><00:05:01.080><c> you'd</c><00:05:01.259><c> find</c><00:05:01.380><c> that</c> performance so I thought you'd find that performance so I thought you'd find that interesting interesting
