look</c><00:01:56.159><c> at</c><00:01:56.340><c> what's</c><00:01:56.520><c> in</c><00:01:56.820><c> like</c><00:01:57.000><c> a</c><00:01:57.240><c> high</c> but if we look at what's in like a high but if we look at what's in like a high quality<00:01:57.720><c> hot</c><00:01:57.960><c> dog</c> quality hot dog quality hot dog the<00:01:59.880><c> meat</c><00:02:00.360><c> typically</c><00:02:00.780><c> comes</c><00:02:01.079><c> from</c><00:02:01.200><c> a</c><00:02:01.439><c> single</c> the meat typically comes from a single the meat typically comes from a single cut<00:02:02.040><c> whether</c><00:02:02.820><c> it</c><00:02:03.060><c> be</c><00:02:03.180><c> beef</c><00:02:04.079><c> or</c><00:02:04.439><c> pork</c><00:02:04.799><c> or</c> cut whether it be beef or pork or cut whether it be beef or pork or whatever whatever whatever and<00:02:07.979><c> so</c><00:02:08.160><c> you</c><00:02:08.520><c> have</c><00:02:08.640><c> a</c><00:02:08.819><c> much</c><00:02:08.940><c> better</c><00:02:09.360><c> idea</c><00:02:09.959><c> of</c> and so you have a much better idea of and so you have a much better idea of where<00:02:10.739><c> this</c><00:02:10.860><c> meat</c><00:02:11.160><c> is</c><00:02:11.280><c> coming</c><00:02:11.459><c> from</c><00:02:11.700><c> you</c><00:02:12.660><c> also</c> where this meat is coming from you also where this meat is coming from you also typically<00:02:13.800><c> have</c><00:02:13.980><c> a</c><00:02:14.099><c> better</c><00:02:14.220><c> knowledge</c><00:02:14.640><c> of</c> typically have a better knowledge of typically have a better knowledge of what<00:02:15.060><c> the</c><00:02:15.239><c> casing</c><00:02:15.599><c> is</c><00:02:15.780><c> made</c><00:02:15.900><c> from</c> what the casing is made from what the casing is made from and<00:02:17.640><c> so</c><00:02:17.959><c> as</c><00:02:18.959><c> you</c><00:02:19.140><c> go</c><00:02:19.260><c> through</c><00:02:19.379><c> this</c><00:02:19.620><c> process</c> and so as you go through this process and so as you go through this process you<00:02:21.480><c> understand</c><00:02:21.980><c> what</c><00:02:22.980><c> the</c><00:02:23.099><c> hot</c><00:02:23.220><c> dog</c><00:02:23.400><c> is</c> you understand what the hot dog is you understand what the hot dog is actually<00:02:23.940><c> made</c><00:02:24.239><c> of</c> actually made of actually made of and<00:02:26.340><c> ideas</c><00:02:26.459><c> are</c><00:02:26.760><c> the</c><00:02:26.940><c>
