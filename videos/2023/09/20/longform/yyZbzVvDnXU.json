the</c><00:02:31.920><c> company</c><00:02:32.099><c> that</c> equitable split of the company that equitable split of the company that makes<00:02:33.120><c> sense</c><00:02:33.420><c>

think</c><00:02:40.739><c> it's</c><00:02:40.860><c> more</c> they're putting in and I think it's more they're putting in and I think it's more complicated<00:02:41.519><c> than</c><00:02:41.819><c> I</c><00:02:42.000><c> initially</c><00:02:42.300><c> wanted</c><00:02:42.540><c> to</c> complicated than I initially wanted to complicated than I initially wanted to believe<00:02:42.959><c> starting</c><00:02:43.620><c> off</c><00:02:43.860><c> it's</c><00:02:44.099><c> really</c><00:02:44.280><c> easy</c><00:02:44.519><c> to</c> believe starting off it's really easy to believe starting off it's really easy to just<00:02:45.000><c> look</c><00:02:45.239><c> at</c><00:02:45.480><c> the</c><00:02:46.080><c> best</c><00:02:46.739><c> possible</c><00:02:47.040><c> outcome</c> just look at the best possible outcome just look at the best possible outcome and<00:02:47.640><c> say</c><00:02:47.819><c> yeah</c><00:02:48.000><c> let's</c><00:02:48.239><c> shoot</c><00:02:48.420><c> for</c><00:02:48.660><c> that</c> and say yeah let's shoot for that and say yeah let's shoot for that um<00:02:50.280><c> but</c> um but um but that's<00:02:52.739><c> not</c><00:02:52.980><c> usually</c><00:02:53.280><c> what</c><00:02:53.459><c> happens</c><00:02:53.640><c> and</c><00:02:54.239><c> so</c> that's not usually what happens and so that's not usually what happens and so you<00:02:54.720><c> need</c><00:02:54.840><c> to</c><00:02:54.900><c> be</c><00:02:55.019><c> realistic</c><00:02:55.560><c> in</c><00:02:55.920><c> the</c><00:02:56.040><c> possible</c> you need to
