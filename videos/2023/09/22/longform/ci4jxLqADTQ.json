there</c><00:10:55.140><c> was</c><00:10:55.320><c> like</c> what I kind of focused on there was like what I kind of focused on there was like the<00:10:55.800><c> idea</c><00:10:56.040><c> of</c><00:10:56.220><c> like</c><00:10:56.399><c> advertising</c><00:10:57.240><c> or</c><00:10:57.540><c> like</c><00:10:57.720><c> hey</c> the idea of like advertising or like hey the idea of like

I<00:11:03.600><c> think</c> I think I think instead<00:11:05.339><c> of</c><00:11:05.459><c> just</c><00:11:05.640><c> like</c><00:11:05.880><c> the</c><00:11:06.120><c> advertising</c> instead of just like the advertising instead of just like the advertising thing<00:11:06.839><c> I</c><00:11:07.140><c> think</c><00:11:07.260><c> that</c><00:11:07.980><c> the</c><00:11:08.160><c> sales</c><00:11:08.339><c> piece</c><00:11:08.760><c> comes</c> thing I think that the sales piece comes thing I think that the sales piece comes in<00:11:09.240><c> too</c><00:11:09.740><c> and</c><00:11:10.740><c> so</c><00:11:10.980><c> one</c><00:11:11.220><c> of</c><00:11:11.339><c> the</c><00:11:11.399><c> things</c><00:11:11.519><c> that</c><00:11:11.760><c> I</c> in too and so one of the things that I in too and so one of the things that I focus<00:11:12.180><c> on</c><00:11:12.360><c> is</c><00:11:13.019><c> like</c><00:11:13.320><c> what's</c><00:11:13.680><c> coming</c><00:11:13.920><c> in</c><00:11:14.160><c> the</c> focus on is like what's coming in the focus on is like what's coming in the future future future because<00:11:15.720><c> I</c><00:11:16.440><c> want</c><00:11:16.620><c> to</c><00:11:16.920><c> be</c><00:11:17.279><c> communicating</c><00:11:18.120><c> some</c> because I want to be communicating some because I want to be communicating some of<00:11:18.959><c> these</c><00:11:19.140><c> ideas</c><00:11:19.320><c> first</c> of these ideas first of these ideas first and<00:11:21.660><c> so</c><00:11:21.899><c> it's</c><00:11:22.260><c> not</c><00:11:22.500><c> about</c><00:11:22.680><c> reaching</c><00:11:23.339><c> the</c> and so it's not about reaching the and so it's not about reaching the widest<00:11:24.600><c> audience</c><00:11:24.899><c> first</c><00:11:25.200><c> it's</c><00:11:25.800><c> about</c> widest audience first it's about widest audience first it's about reaching<00:11:26.519><c> the</c><00:11:26.700><c> people</c><00:11:26.880><c> who</c><00:11:27.180><c> care</c><00:11:27.360><c> about</c> reaching the people who care about reaching the people who

the future what's going to happen in the future likely<00:11:29.880><c> because</c> likely because likely because they<00:11:31.740><c> are</c><00:11:31.980><c> people</c><00:11:32.279><c> building</c><00:11:32.579><c> or</c><00:11:33.060><c> people</c> they are people building or people they are people building or people investing<00:11:34.079><c> in</c><00:11:34.440><c>

shifts<00:12:08.040><c> and</c> shifts and shifts and it<00:12:10.560><c> becomes</c><00:12:11.100><c> not</c><00:12:11.640><c> a</c><00:12:11.820><c> numbers</c><00:12:11.940><c> game</c><00:12:12.360><c> but</c><00:12:12.779><c> an</c> it becomes not a numbers game but an it becomes not a numbers game but an accuracy<00:12:13.440><c> game</c><00:12:13.620><c> and</c><00:12:13.920><c> I</c><00:12:14.040><c> have</c><00:12:14.160><c> to</c><00:12:14.339><c> understand</c> accuracy game and I have to understand accuracy game and I have to understand what<00:12:16.500><c> that</c><00:12:16.620><c> audience</c><00:12:16.920><c> is</c><00:12:17.160><c> and</c><00:12:17.399><c> where</c><00:12:17.579><c> they're</c> what that audience is and where

early</c><00:12:20.519><c> so</c><00:12:21.300><c> that</c><00:12:21.480><c> as</c><00:12:21.779><c> people</c><00:12:22.019><c> are</c> like Trends early so that as people are like Trends early so that as people are searching<00:12:22.680><c> for</c><00:12:22.920><c> Trends</c><00:12:23.459><c> and</c><00:12:23.880><c> trending</c><00:12:24.300><c> ideas</c> searching for Trends and trending ideas searching for Trends and trending ideas they'll<00:12:25.620><c> eventually</c><00:12:25.980><c> stumble</c><00:12:26.820><c> upon</c><00:12:27.120><c> my</c> they'll eventually stumble upon my they'll eventually stumble upon my content<00:12:28.079><c> See</c><00:12:28.260><c> oh</c><00:12:28.560><c> actually</c><00:12:28.800><c> he</c><00:12:29.040><c> was</c><00:12:29.160><c> on</c><00:12:29.339><c> this</c> content See oh actually he was on this content See oh actually he was on this way<00:12:30.779><c> earlier</c><00:12:31.019><c> than</c><00:12:31.140><c> everybody</c><00:12:31.380><c> else</c><00:12:31.800><c> and</c><00:12:32.760><c> use</c> way earlier than everybody else and use way earlier than everybody else and use that<00:12:33.360><c> as</c><00:12:33.480><c> a</c><00:12:33.660><c> signal</c><00:12:33.959><c> that</c><00:12:34.079><c> hey</c><00:12:34.380><c> this</c><00:12:35.160><c> guy</c><00:12:35.279><c> knows</c> that as a
