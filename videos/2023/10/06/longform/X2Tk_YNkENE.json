build billionaire because they can build anything<00:33:13.480><c> like</c><00:33:13.639><c> given</c><00:33:13.880><c> enough</c><00:33:14.159><c> time</c><00:33:14.600><c> you</c> anything like given enough time you anything like given enough time you could<00:33:14.840><c> build</c><00:33:15.080><c> anything</c><00:33:15.440><c> right</c><00:33:15.639><c> like</c><00:33:15.720><c> you</c><00:33:15.880><c> have</c> could build anything right like you have could build anything right like you have the<00:33:16.200><c> ability</c><00:33:16.519><c> to</c><00:33:16.760><c> code</c> the ability to code the ability to code anything<00:33:19.399><c> and</c><00:33:19.519><c> so</c><00:33:19.720><c> there's</c><00:33:19.880><c> an</c><00:33:20.080><c> infinite</c> anything and so there's an infinite anything and so there's an infinite number<00:33:20.639><c> of</c><00:33:20.760><c> things</c><00:33:21.000><c> that</c><00:33:21.120><c> you</c><00:33:21.200><c> can</c> number of

potential</c><00:33:31.639><c> values</c> you sum up all of those potential values you sum up all of those potential values you<00:33:32.159><c> have</c><00:33:32.320><c> a</c><00:33:33.120><c> infinite</c><00:33:33.519><c> amount</c><00:33:33.679><c> of</c><00:33:33.799><c> money</c><00:33:34.080><c> so</c> you have a infinite amount of money so you have a infinite amount of money so you'll<00:33:34.600><c> be</c><00:33:35.000><c> actually</c><00:33:35.200><c> above</c><00:33:35.360><c> a</c> you'll be actually above a you'll be actually above a billionaire<00:33:37.000><c> um</c><00:33:37.720><c> now</c><00:33:37.880><c> the</c><00:33:38.039><c> problem</c><00:33:38.320><c> is</c><00:33:38.559><c> when</c> billionaire um now the problem is when billionaire um now the problem is when you<00:33:38.840><c> actually</c><00:33:39.000><c> start</c><00:33:39.240><c> working</c><00:33:39.600><c> on</c><00:33:39.840><c> something</c> you actually start working on something you actually start working on something you<00:33:40.519><c> start</c><00:33:40.799><c> cutting</c><00:33:41.120><c> down</c><00:33:41.399><c> those</c> you start cutting down those you start cutting down those possibilities<00:33:43.559><c> and</c><00:33:43.760><c> so</c><00:33:44.639><c> people</c><00:33:44.840><c> don't</c><00:33:45.039><c> never</c> possibilities and so people don't never possibilities and so people don't never start<00:33:46.399><c> because</c><00:33:46.639><c> it's</c><00:33:46.799><c> a</c><00:33:46.919><c> lot</c><00:33:47.120><c> easier</c><00:33:47.440><c> to</c><00:33:47.639><c> say</c> start because it's a lot easier to say start because it's a lot easier to say oh<00:33:48.679><c> I</c><00:33:48.799><c> could</c><00:33:48.960><c>

a weekend and then<00:33:51.000><c> never</c><00:33:51.399><c> actually</c><00:33:51.639><c> do</c><00:33:51.840><c> anything</c><00:33:52.159><c> about</c><00:33:52.399><c> it</c> then never actually

the</c><00:41:52.359><c> transcription</c> of it is by doing like the transcription of it is by doing like the transcription you<00:41:53.560><c> get</c><00:41:54.319><c> timestamps</c><00:41:55.319><c> and</c><00:41:55.480><c> you</c><00:41:55.640><c> can</c> you get timestamps and you can you get timestamps and you can use<00:41:57.319><c> like</c><00:41:57.599><c> language</c><00:41:58.079><c> models</c><00:41:58.839><c> to</c><00:41:59.280><c> figure</c><00:41:59.680><c> out</c> use like language models to figure out use like language models to figure out

scarcity</c><00:55:48.079><c> brain</c> about the scarc like the scarcity brain about the scarc like the scarcity brain um<00:55:49.400><c> and</c><00:55:49.559><c> how</c><00:55:49.680><c> our</c><00:55:49.839><c> brains</c><00:55:50.440><c> are</c><00:55:50.680><c> wired</c><00:55:51.480><c> for</c><00:55:52.440><c> like</c> um and how our brains are wired for like um and how our brains are wired for like picking<00:55:53.799><c> up</c><00:55:54.039><c> on</c><00:55:54.319><c> like</c><00:55:54.599><c> potential</c><00:55:55.160><c> scarcity</c><00:55:55.640><c> of</c> picking

really</c><00:55:57.640><c> ties</c><00:55:58.359><c> into</c> resources and like it really ties into resources and like it really ties into the<00:55:59.480><c> way</c><00:55:59.640><c> we</c><00:55:59.799><c> consume</c><00:56:00.240><c> information</c><00:56:01.039><c> because</c> the way we consume information because the way we consume information because we<00:56:02.039><c> essentially</c><00:56:02.559><c> are</c><00:56:02.799><c> like</c><00:56:03.480><c> I</c><00:56:03.559><c> need</c><00:56:03.720><c> all</c><00:56:03.839><c> the</c> we essentially are like I need all the we essentially are like I need all the information<00:56:04.359><c> I</c><00:56:04.440><c> can</c><00:56:04.640><c> get</c><00:56:04.920><c> because</c><00:56:05.079><c> there</c> information I can get because there information I can get because there might<00:56:05.359><c> be</c><00:56:05.440><c> a</c><00:56:05.520><c> point</c><00:56:05.680><c> when</c><00:56:05.799><c> I</c><00:56:05.880><c> don't</c><00:56:06.000><c> have</c><00:56:06.119><c> any</c> might be a point when I don't have any might be a point when I don't have any information<00:56:07.720><c>

is</c><00:56:24.559><c> a</c><00:56:25.000><c> lot</c><00:56:25.119><c> of</c><00:56:25.280><c> [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]</c> lifetime yeah that is a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lifetime yeah that is a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] information<00:56:26.160><c> then</c><00:56:26.280><c> you're</c><00:56:26.480><c> like</c><00:56:26.839><c> oh</c><00:56:27.839><c> no</c> information then you're like oh no information then you're like oh no wonder<00:56:28.359><c> human</c><00:56:28.640><c> brains</c><00:56:28.920><c> are</c><00:56:29.119><c> just</c><00:56:29.359><c> like</c> wonder human brains are just like wonder human brains are just like shutting<00:56:30.400><c> down</c><00:56:30.599><c> and</c><00:56:30.799><c> going</c><00:56:31.359><c> oh</c><00:56:31.680><c> video</c><00:56:32.000><c> game</c><00:56:32.559><c> so</c> shutting down and going oh video game so shutting down and going oh video game so I<00:56:33.680><c> think</c><00:56:33.960><c> content</c><00:56:34.400><c> divides</c><00:56:34.799><c> us</c><00:56:35.000><c> at</c><00:56:35.119><c> the</c><00:56:35.240><c> moment</c> I think content divides us at the moment I think content divides us at the moment because<00:56:35.720><c> we're</c><00:56:35.880><c> looking</c><00:56:36.079><c> at</c><00:56:36.240><c> different</c> because we're looking at different because we're looking at different
