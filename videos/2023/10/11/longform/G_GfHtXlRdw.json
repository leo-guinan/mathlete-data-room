few ways you can do it but as problems get<00:01:22.079><c> more</c><00:01:22.200><c> and</c><00:01:22.320><c> more</c> get more and more get more and more complex<00:01:24.840><c> you</c><00:01:25.000><c> can</c><00:01:25.280><c> identify</c><00:01:26.280><c> errors</c><00:01:26.799><c> in</c><00:01:27.040><c> your</c> complex you can identify errors in your complex you can identify errors in your thinking<00:01:29.000><c> and</c> thinking and thinking and you<00:01:30.600><c> know</c><00:01:30.920><c> it</c><00:01:31.119><c> it's</c><00:01:32.000><c> tough</c><00:01:32.280><c> to</c> you know it it's tough to you know it it's tough to do<00:01:34.479><c> but</c><00:01:34.799><c> if</c><00:01:34.920><c> you</c><00:01:35.159><c>

through it you can check Trace through it you can check individual<00:01:40.960><c> steps</c><00:01:41.960><c> and</c><00:01:42.799><c> you</c><00:01:43.280><c> can</c><00:01:44.280><c> you</c><00:01:44.399><c> know</c> individual steps and you can you know individual steps and you can you know hopefully<00:01:45.240><c> come</c><00:01:45.479><c> up</c><00:01:45.799><c> with</c><00:01:46.640><c> more</c><00:01:46.920><c> correct</c> hopefully come up with more correct hopefully come up with more correct answers<00:01:47.680><c> that</c><00:01:47.799><c> way</c><00:01:48.119><c> and</c><00:01:48.240><c> not</c><00:01:48.399><c> only</c><00:01:48.840><c> that</c><00:01:49.840><c> the</c> answers that way and not only that the answers that way and not only that the teacher<00:01:50.360><c> can</c><00:01:50.600><c> grade</c><00:01:51.000><c> you</c><00:01:51.880><c> knowing</c><00:01:52.759><c> what</c><00:01:53.640><c> you</c> teacher can grade you knowing what you teacher can grade you knowing what you did<00:01:54.399><c> and</c><00:01:54.520><c> can</c><00:01:54.759><c> actually</c><00:01:55.040><c> give</c><00:01:55.360><c> partial</c><00:01:56.079><c> Credit</c> did and can actually give partial Credit did and can actually give partial Credit Now<00:01:57.759><c> why</c><00:01:58.000><c> am</c><00:01:58.119><c> I</c><00:01:58.280><c> talking</c><00:01:58.600><c> about</c><00:01:58.880><c> this</c><00:01:59.119><c> in</c> Now why am I talking about this in Now why am I talking about this in
