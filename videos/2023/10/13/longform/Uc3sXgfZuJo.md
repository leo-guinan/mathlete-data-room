it's</c> and then people realized that oh it's and then people realized that oh it's valuable<00:01:39.439><c> we're</c><00:01:39.560><c> going</c><00:01:39.640><c> to</c><00:01:39.720><c> track</c><00:01:39.920><c> all</c><00:01:40.040><c> these</c> valuable we're going to track all these valuable we're going to track all these metrics<00:01:40.600><c> on</c><00:01:40.880><c> exactly</c><00:01:41.240><c> what's</c><00:01:41.439><c> working</c><00:01:41.720><c> and</c> metrics on exactly what's working and metrics on exactly what's working and what's<00:01:42.040><c> not</c> what's not what's not working<00:01:44.119><c> but</c><00:01:45.119><c> in</c><00:01:45.280><c> the</c><00:01:45.439><c> end</c><00:01:45.880><c> like</c><00:01:46.320><c> it's</c><00:01:46.560><c> it's</c> working but in the end like it's it's working but in the end like it's it's this<00:01:46.920><c> is</c><00:01:47.040><c> the</c><00:01:47.240><c>

certain<00:02:22.519><c> problem</c><00:02:22.840><c> or</c><00:02:23.040><c> having</c><00:02:23.280><c> some</c><00:02:23.440><c> sort</c><00:02:23.640><c> of</c> certain problem or having some sort of certain problem or having some sort of outcome<00:02:24.879><c> it's</c><00:02:25.160><c> all</c> outcome it's all outcome it's all about<00:02:27.920><c> focusing</c><00:02:28.440><c> on</c><00:02:28.720><c> that</c><00:02:29.000><c> problem</c> about focusing on that problem about focusing on that problem all<00:02:31.000><c> the</c><00:02:31.080><c> other</c><00:02:31.280><c> metrics</c><00:02:32.080><c> are</c><00:02:32.319><c> just</c><00:02:32.599><c> kind</c><00:02:32.800><c> of</c> all the other metrics are just kind of all the other metrics are just kind of noise<00:02:34.040><c> in</c><00:02:34.160><c> the</c> noise in the noise in the background background background now<00:02:38.239><c> the</c><00:02:38.400><c> trick</c><00:02:38.720><c> is</c><00:02:38.920><c> actually</c><00:02:39.159><c> getting</c><00:02:39.400><c> people</c> now the trick is actually getting people now the trick is actually getting people like<00:02:39.879><c> that</c><00:02:40.640><c> to</c><00:02:40.800><c> use</c><00:02:41.120><c> metrics</c> like that to use metrics like that to use metrics effectively<00:02:43.720><c> because</c><00:02:44.200><c>
