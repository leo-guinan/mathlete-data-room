open</c> of this cycle we've got like open of this cycle we've got like open research<00:02:53.599><c> coming</c><00:02:53.920><c> out</c><00:02:54.760><c> and</c><00:02:54.959><c> then</c><00:02:55.400><c> that</c><00:02:55.879><c> gets</c> research coming out and then that gets research coming out and then that gets turned<00:02:56.480><c> very</c><00:02:56.720><c> very</c><00:02:56.920><c> quickly</c><00:02:57.360><c> into</c><00:02:57.640><c> code</c><00:02:57.920><c> and</c> turned very very quickly into code and turned very very quickly into code and open<00:02:58.400><c> source</c><00:02:59.360><c> reposit</c><00:02:59.920><c> atories</c><00:03:00.920><c> that</c><00:03:01.159><c> a</c><00:03:01.280><c> lot</c> open source reposit atories that a

are</c> of the developers in the space are of the developers in the space are already<00:03:03.560><c> using</c><00:03:04.560><c> and</c><00:03:04.879><c> so</c><00:03:05.720><c> it's</c><00:03:05.959><c> hard</c><00:03:06.120><c> to</c><00:03:06.280><c> keep</c> already using and so it's hard to keep already using and so it's hard to keep up<00:03:06.680><c> and</c><00:03:06.760><c> one</c><00:03:06.879><c> of</c><00:03:06.959><c> the</c><00:03:07.080><c> things</c><00:03:07.280><c> I</c><00:03:07.400><c> have</c><00:03:07.480><c> to</c><00:03:07.599><c> keep</c> up and one of the things I have to keep up and one of the things I have to keep doing<00:03:08.480><c> I</c><00:03:08.599><c> use</c><00:03:08.799><c> Lang</c><00:03:09.040><c> chain</c> doing I use Lang chain doing I use Lang chain personally<00:03:10.959><c> and</c><00:03:11.080><c> so</c><00:03:11.200><c> I</c><00:03:11.280><c> have</c><00:03:11.400><c> to</c><00:03:11.560><c>

the</c><00:03:12.840><c> latest</c> updating Lang chain to the latest updating Lang chain to the latest version<00:03:13.480><c> and</c><00:03:13.680><c> figuring</c><00:03:14.040><c> out</c><00:03:14.280><c> what</c><00:03:14.400><c> all</c><00:03:14.560><c> is</c> version and figuring out what all is version and figuring out what all is different<00:03:15.200><c> because</c><00:03:15.400><c> it</c><00:03:15.920><c> is</c><00:03:16.920><c> advancing</c><00:03:17.560><c> so</c><00:03:17.799><c> so</c> different because it is advancing so so different because it is advancing so so quickly<00:03:18.319><c> I</c><00:03:18.400><c> want</c><00:03:18.519><c> to</c><00:03:18.640><c> stay</c><00:03:19.120><c> up</c><00:03:19.319><c> toate</c><00:03:19.799><c> on</c><00:03:20.040><c> the</c> quickly I want to stay up toate on the quickly I want to stay up toate on the latest<00:03:20.640><c> techniques</c><00:03:21.640><c> not</c><00:03:21.799><c> to</c><00:03:22.000><c> mention</c><00:03:22.879><c> a</c><00:03:22.959><c> lot</c> latest techniques not to mention a lot latest techniques not to mention a lot of<00:03:23.239><c> times</c><00:03:23.519><c> just</c><00:03:23.920><c> the</c><00:03:24.720><c> uh</c> of times just the uh of times just the uh documentation<00:03:27.560><c> um</c><00:03:28.400><c> is</c><00:03:28.519><c> more</c><00:03:28.720><c> aligned</c><00:03:29.120><c> with</c> documentation um is more aligned with documentation um is more aligned with the<00:03:29.319><c> latest</c><00:03:29.799><c> version</c><00:03:30.239><c> right</c><00:03:30.519><c> and</c><00:03:30.720><c> so</c><00:03:31.319><c> there's</c> the latest version right and so there's the latest version right and so there's all<00:03:31.760><c> sorts</c><00:03:32.000><c> of</c><00:03:32.159><c> things</c><00:03:32.439><c> that</c><00:03:33.000><c> just</c><00:03:33.200><c> being</c><00:03:33.480><c> on</c> all sorts of things that just being on all sorts of things that just being on kind<00:03:33.799><c> of</c><00:03:33.920><c> the</c><00:03:34.040><c> newest</c><00:03:34.400><c> version</c><00:03:35.400><c> uh</c><00:03:35.599><c> really</c> kind of the newest version uh really kind of the newest version uh really helps<00:03:36.159><c> with</c><00:03:36.799><c> but</c><00:03:37.799><c> it's</c><00:03:38.040><c> tough</c><00:03:38.319><c> when</c><00:03:38.519><c> things</c> helps with but it's tough when things helps with but it's tough when things change<00:03:39.959><c> and</c><00:03:40.159><c> evolve</c><00:03:40.560><c> over</c><00:03:40.799><c> time</c><00:03:41.040><c> and</c><00:03:41.120><c> they</c> change and evolve over time and they change and evolve over time and they evolve<00:03:41.560><c> so</c><00:03:41.920><c> quickly</c><00:03:42.920><c> and</c> evolve so quickly and evolve so quickly and so<00:03:45.720><c> the</c><00:03:45.879><c> average</c><00:03:46.200><c> person</c><00:03:46.519><c> I</c><00:03:46.599><c> think</c><00:03:46.799><c> gets</c><00:03:47.000><c> lost</c> so the average person I think gets lost so the average person I think gets lost in<00:03:47.319><c> the</c><00:03:47.920><c> shuffle</c> in the shuffle in the shuffle and<00:03:50.439><c> so</c><00:03:51.200><c> I</c><00:03:51.319><c> wanted</c><00:03:51.680><c> to</c><00:03:51.879><c> take</c><00:03:52.000><c> a</c><00:03:52.159><c> step</c><00:03:52.439><c> back</c><00:03:52.959><c> and</c> and so I wanted to take a step back and and so I wanted to take a step back and say<00:03:53.599><c> like</c><00:03:54.040><c> okay</c><00:03:54.280><c> what</c><00:03:54.400><c>

longer<00:03:56.920><c> term</c><00:03:57.319><c> level</c><00:03:58.120><c> if</c><00:03:58.200><c> you</c><00:03:58.319><c> listen</c><00:03:58.560><c> to</c> longer term level if you listen to longer term level if you listen to people<00:03:58.879><c> in</c><00:03:59.040><c> AI</c><00:03:59.400><c> we</c><00:03:59.760><c> all</c><00:03:59.920><c> excited</c><00:04:00.280><c> that</c><00:04:00.439><c> the</c> people in AI we all excited that the people in AI we all excited that the world<00:04:00.720><c> is</c><00:04:00.879><c> going</c><00:04:01.040><c> to</c><00:04:01.200><c> change</c><00:04:01.879><c> overnight</c><00:04:02.879><c> and</c> world is going to change overnight and world is going to change overnight and it<00:04:04.159><c> probably</c><00:04:04.640><c> will</c><00:04:05.439><c> from</c><00:04:06.040><c> a</c><00:04:06.400><c> human</c><00:04:06.799><c> existence</c> it probably will from a human existence it probably will from a human existence point<00:04:08.000><c> of</c><00:04:08.480><c> view</c><00:04:09.480><c> but</c><00:04:10.400><c> not</c><00:04:10.840><c> necessarily</c><00:04:11.439><c> the</c> point of view but not necessarily the point of view but not necessarily the blink<00:04:11.760><c> of</c><00:04:11.879><c> an</c><00:04:12.000><c> eye</c><00:04:12.640><c> from</c><00:04:13.640><c> an</c><00:04:13.840><c> individual</c><00:04:14.519><c> human</c> blink of an eye from an individual human blink of an eye from an individual human point<00:04:15.159><c> of</c><00:04:15.440><c> view</c> point of view point of view so<00:04:18.400><c> I</c><00:04:18.600><c> expect</c><00:04:19.120><c> probably</c><00:04:19.440><c> within</c><00:04:19.680><c> the</c><00:04:19.799><c> next</c> so I expect probably within the next so I expect probably within the next three<00:04:20.160><c> to</c><00:04:20.359><c> five</c><00:04:20.519><c> years</c><00:04:20.840><c> we'll</c><00:04:21.040><c> start</c><00:04:21.239><c> to</c><00:04:21.400><c> see</c> three to five years we'll start to see three to five years we'll start to see some<00:04:23.120><c> uh</c><00:04:23.800><c> more</c><00:04:24.280><c> major</c><00:04:24.600><c> shifts</c><00:04:25.280><c> in</c><00:04:25.600><c> how</c><00:04:25.800><c> people</c> some uh more major shifts in how people some uh more major shifts in how people operate<00:04:27.320><c> but</c><00:04:28.080><c> one</c><00:04:28.280><c> of</c><00:04:28.520><c> the</c><00:04:28.720><c> things</c><00:04:29.000><c> that's</c> operate but one

is that<00:04:33.600><c> technology</c><00:04:34.440><c> tends</c><00:04:34.800><c> to</c><00:04:35.039><c> automate</c><00:04:36.000><c> the</c> that technology tends to automate the that technology

and</c><00:04:39.720><c> the</c><00:04:39.840><c> reason</c><00:04:40.160><c> this</c><00:04:40.240><c> is</c><00:04:40.440><c> actually</c><00:04:40.600><c> a</c> can and the reason this is actually a can and the reason this is actually a really<00:04:40.919><c> good</c><00:04:41.160><c> thing</c><00:04:41.479><c> is</c><00:04:41.639><c> it</c><00:04:41.840><c> enables</c><00:04:42.360><c> humans</c> really good thing is it enables humans really good thing is it enables humans to<00:04:43.639><c> move</c><00:04:44.400><c> up</c><00:04:44.680><c> the</c><00:04:44.880><c>

I<00:05:16.960><c> believe</c><00:05:17.800><c> so</c><00:05:18.039><c> instead</c><00:05:18.319><c> of</c><00:05:18.520><c> humans</c><00:05:19.080><c> doing</c><00:05:19.440><c> a</c> I believe so
