of</c><00:04:06.959><c> it</c><00:04:07.920><c> now</c><00:04:08.159><c> the</c> that's the second part of it now the that's the second part of it now the third<00:04:08.680><c> part</c><00:04:09.239><c> is</c><00:04:09.400><c> something</c><00:04:09.640><c> I'm</c><00:04:09.760><c> calling</c> third part is something I'm calling third part is something I'm calling memories<00:04:10.720><c> and</c><00:04:10.959><c> so</c><00:04:11.560><c> what</c><00:04:11.680><c> I</c><00:04:11.799><c> wanted</c><00:04:12.040><c> to</c><00:04:12.280><c> do</c><00:04:13.280><c> is</c> memories and so what I wanted to do is memories and so what I wanted to do is be<00:04:13.879><c> able</c><00:04:14.120><c> to</c><00:04:14.360><c> learn</c><00:04:15.280><c>

it</c><00:06:55.000><c> the</c><00:06:56.280><c> blog</c> differently and so I gave it the blog differently and so I gave it the blog and<00:06:57.639><c> told</c><00:06:57.840><c> it</c><00:06:57.960><c> to</c><00:06:58.039><c> learn</c><00:06:58.240><c> about</c><00:06:58.440><c> it</c><00:06:58.680><c> and</c><00:06:58.840><c> then</c> and told it to learn about it and then and told it to learn about it and then asked<00:06:59.720><c> a</c><00:06:59.919><c> question</c><00:07:00.440><c> about</c><00:07:00.800><c> the</c><00:07:00.960><c> Paradox</c> asked a question about the Paradox asked a question about the Paradox discoverability<00:07:02.800><c> and</c><00:07:03.199><c> saw</c><00:07:03.720><c> that</c><00:07:03.960><c> the</c><00:07:04.120><c> answer</c> discoverability and saw that the answer discoverability and saw that the answer changed<00:07:05.000><c> from</c><00:07:05.520><c> the</c><00:07:05.720><c> first</c><00:07:06.120><c>

which</c><00:07:07.720><c> is</c> second version which is second version which is mine<00:07:09.800><c> um</c><00:07:10.800><c> so</c><00:07:11.039><c> that</c><00:07:11.160><c> to</c><00:07:11.319><c> me</c><00:07:11.479><c> is</c><00:07:11.639><c> really</c><00:07:11.879><c> really</c> mine um so that to me is really really mine um so that to me is really really interesting interesting interesting because<00:07:14.479><c> I</c><00:07:14.560><c> think</c><00:07:14.720><c> it</c><00:07:14.879><c> does</c><00:07:15.039><c> show</c><00:07:15.479><c> a</c><00:07:15.639><c>
