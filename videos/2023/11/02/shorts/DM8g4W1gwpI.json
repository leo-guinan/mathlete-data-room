comfortable with what you're creating comfortable with what you're creating then<00:00:48.160><c> you</c><00:00:48.239><c> can</c><00:00:48.480><c> look</c><00:00:48.640><c> at</c><00:00:48.800><c> better</c><00:00:49.000><c> ways</c><00:00:49.199><c> to</c> then you can look at better ways to then you can look at better ways to distribute<00:00:49.800><c> it</c>",
