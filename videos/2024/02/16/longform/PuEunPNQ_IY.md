Kind: captions Language: en [Music] I<00:00:10.360><c> started</c><00:00:10.679><c> studying</c><00:00:11.040><c> the</c><00:00:11.280><c> creater</c><00:00:11.679><c> economy</c> I started studying the creater economy I started studying the creater economy three<00:00:12.679><c> years</c> three years three years ago ago ago and<00:00:16.000><c> the</c><00:00:16.119><c> reason</c><00:00:16.480><c> I</c><00:00:16.600><c> got</c><00:00:16.760><c> so</c><00:00:16.960><c> into</c><00:00:17.240><c> it</c><00:00:17.439><c> was</c> and the reason I got so into it was and the reason I got so into it was because<00:00:18.080><c> it</c><00:00:18.240><c> felt</c><00:00:18.720><c> so</c><00:00:19.000><c> much</c><00:00:19.400><c> different</c><00:00:20.119><c> from</c> because it felt so much different from because it felt so much different from the<00:00:21.160><c> economy</c><00:00:21.760><c> that</c><00:00:21.920><c> I</c><00:00:22.119><c> was</c><00:00:22.279><c> told</c><00:00:22.560><c> that</c> the economy that I was told that the economy that I was told that existed<00:00:24.560><c> and</c><00:00:25.560><c> I</c><00:00:25.680><c> really</c><00:00:25.880><c> wanted</c><00:00:26.119><c> to</c><00:00:26.279><c> figure</c> existed and I really wanted to figure existed and I really wanted to figure out<00:00:28.400><c> what</c><00:00:28.599><c> was</c><00:00:28.760><c> so</c><00:00:29.039><c> different</c><00:00:30.279><c> how</c><00:00:30.439><c> do</c><00:00:30.880><c> we</c> out what was so different how do we out what was so different how do we value<00:00:32.480><c> these</c><00:00:32.880><c> incredibly</c><00:00:33.640><c> different</c><00:00:34.320><c> ideas</c> value these incredibly different ideas value these incredibly different ideas of<00:00:35.200><c> what</c><00:00:35.320><c> it</c><00:00:35.440><c> means</c><00:00:35.840><c> to</c><00:00:36.440><c> work</c><00:00:37.440><c> and</c><00:00:38.200><c> that's</c><00:00:38.360><c> what</c> of what it means to work and that's what of what it means to work and that's what led<00:00:38.719><c> me</c><00:00:38.840><c> to</c><00:00:39.079><c> this</c><00:00:39.520><c> concept</c><00:00:40.120><c> of</c><00:00:40.480><c> quantum</c> led me to this concept of quantum led me to this concept of quantum economics<00:00:43.160><c> because</c><00:00:44.160><c> I</c><00:00:44.280><c> realized</c><00:00:44.800><c> something</c> economics because I realized something economics because I realized something in<00:00:46.360><c> how</c><00:00:46.640><c> we</c><00:00:47.199><c> determine</c><00:00:48.199><c> what's</c> in how we determine what's in how we determine what's valuable<00:00:50.199><c> we</c> valuable we valuable we don't<00:00:52.320><c> actually</c><00:00:53.320><c> use</c><00:00:53.640><c> all</c><00:00:53.800><c> the</c><00:00:54.000><c> data</c><00:00:54.320><c> we</c><00:00:54.440><c> only</c> don't actually use all the data we only don't actually use all the data we only use<00:00:54.960><c> part</c><00:00:55.120><c> of</c><00:00:55.239><c> it</c><00:00:56.199><c> and</c><00:00:56.640><c> so</c><00:00:57.640><c> we</c><00:00:57.879><c> compress</c><00:00:58.399><c> data</c> use part of it and so we compress data use part of it and so we compress data down<00:00:59.440><c> a</c><00:00:59.559><c> whole</c><00:00:59.719><c> bunch</c><00:00:59.960><c> buch</c><00:01:00.680><c> and</c><00:01:01.160><c> as</c><00:01:01.359><c> creators</c> down a whole bunch buch and as creators down a whole bunch buch and as creators we<00:01:01.960><c> typically</c><00:01:02.320><c> do</c><00:01:02.600><c> this</c><00:01:02.920><c> by</c><00:01:03.680><c> taking</c><00:01:04.479><c> our</c> we typically do this by taking our we typically do this by taking our audience<00:01:06.360><c> makeup</c><00:01:07.119><c> right</c><00:01:07.360><c> and</c><00:01:07.520><c> compressing</c> audience makeup right and compressing audience makeup right and compressing them<00:01:08.159><c> down</c><00:01:08.479><c> into</c><00:01:09.080><c> demographic</c><00:01:09.640><c> metrics</c><00:01:10.280><c> or</c> them down into demographic metrics or them down into demographic metrics or audience<00:01:11.200><c> size</c><00:01:11.680><c> metrics</c><00:01:12.680><c> something</c><00:01:13.000><c> that</c><00:01:13.119><c> you</c> audience size metrics something that you audience size metrics something that you can<00:01:13.479><c> use</c><00:01:13.960><c> to</c><00:01:14.960><c> convey</c><00:01:15.439><c> the</c><00:01:15.640><c> value</c><00:01:16.000><c> of</c><00:01:16.119><c> your</c> can use to convey the value of your can use to convey the value of your audience<00:01:16.799><c> from</c><00:01:17.000><c> one</c><00:01:17.360><c> context</c><00:01:17.920><c> into</c><00:01:18.680><c> another</c> audience from one context into another audience from one context into another and<00:01:20.159><c> try</c><00:01:20.360><c> to</c><00:01:20.520><c> convert</c><00:01:20.799><c> it</c><00:01:20.920><c> into</c><00:01:21.119><c> something</c> and try to convert it into something and try to convert it into something like<00:01:21.560><c> sponsorship</c><00:01:22.119><c> dollars</c><00:01:23.040><c> right</c><00:01:24.040><c> and</c><00:01:25.000><c> the</c> like sponsorship dollars right and the like sponsorship dollars right and the problem<00:01:25.400><c> with</c><00:01:25.560><c> this</c><00:01:25.720><c> model</c><00:01:26.640><c> is</c><00:01:26.759><c> that</c><00:01:26.920><c> it</c> problem with this model is that it problem with this model is that it doesn't<00:01:27.400><c> actually</c> doesn't actually doesn't actually capture capture capture the<00:01:31.240><c> value</c><00:01:32.240><c> of</c><00:01:32.479><c> the</c> the value of the the value of the people<00:01:34.439><c> that</c><00:01:34.560><c> we</c><00:01:34.720><c> compress</c><00:01:35.119><c> up</c><00:01:35.280><c> into</c><00:01:35.560><c> these</c> people that we compress up into these people that we compress up into these little<00:01:36.040><c> chunks</c><00:01:36.360><c> of</c><00:01:36.520><c> data</c><00:01:37.439><c> and</c><00:01:38.079><c> so</c><00:01:39.079><c> this</c><00:01:39.200><c> has</c> little chunks of data and so this has little chunks of data and so this has actually<00:01:39.560><c> led</c><00:01:39.759><c> us</c><00:01:39.880><c> to</c><00:01:40.200><c> completely</c> actually led us to completely actually led us to completely miscalculate<00:01:41.640><c> the</c><00:01:41.799><c> prices</c><00:01:42.320><c> of</c><00:01:42.439><c> things</c><00:01:42.640><c> in</c><00:01:42.759><c> the</c> miscalculate the prices of things in the miscalculate the prices of things in the Creator<00:01:43.479><c> economy</c><00:01:44.479><c> and</c><00:01:44.719><c> this</c><00:01:44.840><c> has</c><00:01:45.000><c> been</c> Creator economy and this has been Creator economy and this has been further<00:01:45.520><c> muddled</c><00:01:46.000><c> by</c><00:01:46.200><c> things</c><00:01:46.560><c> like</c><00:01:46.840><c> Venture</c> further muddled by things like Venture further muddled by things like Venture Capital<00:01:48.159><c> who</c><00:01:48.640><c> has</c><00:01:49.320><c> another</c><00:01:49.759><c> completely</c> Capital who has another completely Capital who has

industry</c><00:02:11.200><c> of</c><00:02:11.319><c> venture</c> actually like the industry of venture actually like the industry of venture capital<00:02:11.920><c> and</c><00:02:12.040><c> how</c><00:02:12.200><c> it's</c><00:02:12.319><c> currently</c> capital and how it's currently capital and how it's currently structured<00:02:13.959><c> um</c><00:02:14.360><c> I</c><00:02:14.680><c> understand</c><00:02:14.840><c> where</c><00:02:14.920><c> it</c><00:02:15.080><c> came</c> structured um I understand where it came structured um I understand where it came from<00:02:16.000><c> I</c><00:02:16.360><c> understand</c><00:02:16.560><c> why</c><00:02:16.680><c> people</c><00:02:17.160><c> are</c><00:02:17.319><c> going</c> from I understand why people are

forward</c><00:02:20.360><c> into</c> for it but I think moving forward into for it but I think moving forward into the<00:02:21.120><c> future</c><00:02:22.120><c> we</c><00:02:22.280><c> need</c><00:02:22.480><c> to</c><00:02:22.920><c> really</c><00:02:23.239><c> seriously</c> the future we need to really seriously the future we need to really seriously evaluate<00:02:24.519><c> that</c><00:02:24.800><c> model</c><00:02:25.319><c> and</c><00:02:25.720><c> change</c><00:02:26.040><c> it</c><00:02:26.720><c> for</c> evaluate that model and change it for evaluate that model and change it for the<00:02:27.040><c> better</c> the better the better because<00:02:29.560><c> man</c><00:02:29.879><c> and</c><00:02:30.160><c> there</c><00:02:30.280><c> is</c><00:02:30.440><c> a</c><00:02:30.560><c> ton</c><00:02:30.760><c> of</c><00:02:30.879><c> money</c> because man and there is a ton of money because man and there is a ton of money wasted<00:02:31.480><c> in</c><00:02:31.640><c> that</c><00:02:31.800><c> industry</c><00:02:32.360><c> because</c><00:02:32.640><c> it's</c> wasted in that industry because it's wasted in that industry because it's just<00:02:33.160><c> not</c><00:02:33.680><c> an</c><00:02:33.920><c> accurate</c><00:02:34.400><c> capture</c><00:02:35.360><c> of</c><00:02:36.360><c> the</c> just not an accurate capture of the

to<00:02:49.959><c> understand</c><00:02:50.200><c> how</c><00:02:50.319><c> to</c><00:02:50.560><c> Value</c><00:02:51.040><c> themselves</c><00:02:51.360><c> in</c> to understand how to Value themselves in to understand how to Value themselves in today's<00:02:51.920><c> economy</c><00:02:52.560><c> and</c><00:02:52.760><c> that</c><00:02:52.840><c> is</c><00:02:52.959><c> a</c><00:02:53.080><c> very</c> today's economy and that is a very today's economy and that is a very difficult<00:02:53.519><c> thing</c><00:02:53.640><c> to</c><00:02:53.800><c> do</c><00:02:54.120><c> and</c><00:02:54.440><c> I</c><00:02:54.599><c> have</c><00:02:54.680><c> a</c><00:02:54.800><c> hard</c> difficult thing to do and I have a hard difficult thing to do and I have a hard time<00:02:55.120><c> doing</c><00:02:55.400><c> it</c><00:02:56.720><c> and</c><00:02:57.720><c> that</c><00:02:57.840><c> was</c><00:02:57.959><c> one</c><00:02:58.080><c> of</c><00:02:58.200><c> the</c> time doing it and that was one of the time doing it and that was one of the things<00:02:58.480><c> that</c><00:02:58.640><c> again</c><00:02:58.840><c>
