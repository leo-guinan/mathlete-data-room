on that journey I want this to be a collaborative collaborative collaborative exercise<00:03:37.000><c> I</c><00:03:37.080><c> think</c><00:03:37.280><c> one</c><00:03:37.400><c>

right<00:05:19.720><c> and</c><00:05:20.199><c> so</c><00:05:21.199><c> if</c><00:05:21.319><c> you</c><00:05:21.400><c> say</c><00:05:21.560><c> you</c><00:05:21.639><c> have</c><00:05:21.759><c> a</c> right and so if you say you have a right and so if you say you have a system<00:05:22.039><c> that</c><00:05:22.160><c> does</c><00:05:22.360><c> one</c><00:05:22.560><c> thing</c><00:05:22.840><c> but</c><00:05:22.960><c> it</c><00:05:23.080><c> does</c> system that does one thing but it does system that does one thing but it does another<00:05:23.680><c> thing</c><00:05:24.120><c> then</c><00:05:24.400><c> the</c><00:05:24.520><c> purpose</c><00:05:24.800><c> of</c><00:05:24.919><c> the</c> another thing then the purpose of the another thing then the purpose of the system<00:05:25.319><c> is</c><00:05:25.479><c> the</c><00:05:25.600><c> thing</c><00:05:25.759><c> that</c><00:05:25.840><c> it</c><00:05:26.039><c> actually</c> system is the thing that it actually system is the thing that it actually does<00:05:28.520><c> and</c><00:05:29.600><c> I</c><00:05:29.720><c> think</c><00:05:30.600><c> our</c><00:05:30.960><c> system</c><00:05:31.280><c> of</c><00:05:31.520><c> business</c> does and I think our system of business does and I think our system of business and<00:05:32.639><c> this</c><00:05:33.440><c> really</c><00:05:33.800><c> weird</c> and this really weird and this really weird like<00:05:35.880><c> ownership</c><00:05:36.759><c> and</c><00:05:36.919><c> deferred</c><00:05:37.720><c> liquidity</c> like ownership and deferred liquidity like ownership and deferred liquidity and<00:05:39.440><c> valuation</c><00:05:40.199><c> models</c><00:05:41.080><c> and</c><00:05:41.360><c> all</c><00:05:41.520><c> of</c><00:05:41.720><c> this</c> and valuation models and all of this and valuation models and all of this they're<00:05:42.319><c> all</c><00:05:42.479><c> incredibly</c><00:05:42.919><c> outdated</c><00:05:43.759><c> and</c><00:05:43.960><c> they</c> they're all incredibly outdated and they they're all incredibly outdated and they don't<00:05:44.840><c> function</c><00:05:45.840><c> in</c><00:05:46.120><c> any</c><00:05:46.360><c> way</c><00:05:46.759><c> efficiently</c><00:05:47.759><c> in</c> don't function in any way efficiently in don't function in any way efficiently in this<00:05:48.360><c> new</c><00:05:48.600><c> digital</c><00:05:49.360><c> economy</c><00:05:50.360><c> and</c><00:05:51.280><c> so</c><00:05:51.840><c> we</c><00:05:51.960><c> can</c> this new digital economy and so we can this new digital economy and so we can actually<00:05:52.639><c> make</c><00:05:52.919><c> a</c><00:05:53.080><c> big</c><00:05:53.280><c> shift</c><00:05:53.960><c> to</c><00:05:54.840><c> get</c><00:05:55.000><c> it</c><00:05:55.120><c> to</c> actually make a big shift to get it to actually make a big shift to get it to function<00:05:55.680><c> the</c><00:05:55.800><c> way</c><00:05:55.960><c> that</c><00:05:56.120><c> it</c><00:05:56.720><c> should</c><00:05:57.720><c> uh</c><00:05:58.720><c> in</c> function the way that it should uh in function the way that it should uh in kind<00:05:59.160><c> of</c><00:05:59.319><c> this</c><00:05:59.560><c> this</c><00:06:00.319><c> Quantum</c><00:06:00.880><c> economic</c><00:06:01.479><c> state</c> kind of this this Quantum economic state kind of this this Quantum economic state that<00:06:02.080><c> I'm</c><00:06:02.680><c>
