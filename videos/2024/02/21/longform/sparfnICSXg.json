how</c><00:00:59.239><c> do</c><00:00:59.320><c> you</c><00:00:59.480><c> communicate</c> quickly so how do you communicate quickly so how do you communicate unicate<00:01:01.079><c> what</c><00:01:01.280><c> everybody's</c><00:01:01.760><c> doing</c><00:01:02.079><c> to</c><00:01:02.239><c> where</c> unicate what everybody's doing to where unicate what everybody's doing to where everybody<00:01:02.879><c> has</c><00:01:03.120><c> that</c><00:01:03.280><c> full</c> everybody has that full everybody has that full context<00:01:05.640><c> but</c><00:01:06.640><c> doesn't</c><00:01:07.040><c> need</c> context but doesn't need context but doesn't need to<00:01:09.080><c> be</c><00:01:09.280><c> focusing</c><00:01:09.680><c> on</c><00:01:09.799><c> it</c><00:01:09.880><c> all</c><00:01:10.000><c> the</c> to be focusing on it all the to be focusing on it all the time<00:01:12.320><c> it's</c><00:01:12.600><c> it's</c><00:01:12.720><c> a</c><00:01:12.920><c> very</c><00:01:13.159><c> delicate</c><00:01:13.560><c> balance</c> time it's it's a very delicate balance time it's it's a very delicate balance and<00:01:14.320><c> something</c><00:01:14.759><c> that</c><00:01:14.960><c> I</c><00:01:15.479><c> think</c><00:01:16.479><c> as</c><00:01:16.720><c> humans</c> and something that I think as humans and something that I think as humans it's<00:01:17.720><c> very</c><00:01:17.960><c> tough</c><00:01:18.119><c> to</c><00:01:18.520><c> do</c><00:01:19.520><c> especially</c><00:01:19.880><c> in</c> it's very tough to do especially in it's very tough to do especially in today's<00:01:20.320><c> society</c><00:01:20.799><c> which</c><00:01:20.960><c> I</c><00:01:21.040><c> think</c> today's society which I think today's society which I think doesn't<00:01:23.040><c> teach</c><00:01:23.320><c> us</c><00:01:23.479><c> how</c><00:01:23.600><c> to</c><00:01:23.840><c> communicate</c> doesn't teach us how to communicate doesn't teach us how to communicate particularly<00:01:25.320><c> effectively</c><00:01:25.880><c> it's</c><00:01:26.040><c> something</c> particularly effectively it's something particularly effectively it's something a<00:01:26.439><c> lot</c><00:01:26.560><c> of</c><00:01:26.680><c> us</c><00:01:26.840><c> have</c><00:01:26.960><c> to</c><00:01:27.079><c>

the</c><00:01:33.439><c> trick</c> but I think the trick but I think the trick here<00:01:35.479><c> is</c><00:01:36.360><c> to</c><00:01:36.840><c> communicate</c><00:01:37.399><c> without</c> here is to communicate without here is to communicate without communicating<00:01:39.159><c> what</c><00:01:39.280><c> do</c><00:01:39.360><c> I</c><00:01:39.439><c> mean</c><00:01:39.640><c> by</c><00:01:39.799><c> that</c><00:01:40.119><c> so</c> communicating what do I mean by that so communicating what do I mean by that so typically<00:01:42.079><c> when</c><00:01:42.439><c> you're</c><00:01:42.680><c> communicating</c><00:01:43.240><c> with</c> typically when you're communicating with typically when you're communicating with someone<00:01:45.159><c> you</c><00:01:45.960><c> know</c><00:01:46.200><c> what</c><00:01:46.320><c> you</c><00:01:46.520><c> know</c><00:01:47.280><c> and</c><00:01:47.439><c> you</c> someone you know what you know and you

the cool thing is it's notepad uh but the cool thing is it's got<00:04:23.280><c> a</c><00:04:24.000><c> task</c><00:04:24.360><c> list</c><00:04:24.720><c> that</c><00:04:24.880><c> I'm</c><00:04:25.040><c> planning</c><00:04:25.320><c> on</c> got a task list that I'm planning on got a task list that I'm planning on teaching<00:04:25.720><c> it</c><00:04:25.919><c> how</c><00:04:26.080><c> to</c><00:04:26.280><c> do</c><00:04:27.040><c> itself</c><00:04:28.040><c> um</c><00:04:28.320><c> so</c> teaching it how to do itself um so teaching it how to do itself um so basically<00:04:28.919><c> as</c><00:04:29.000><c> you</c><00:04:29.160><c> put</c><00:04:29.280><c> in</c><00:04:29.440><c> things</c><00:04:29.840><c> and</c> basically as you put in things and basically as you put in things and thoughts<00:04:30.720><c> it'll</c><00:04:31.000><c> identify</c><00:04:31.560><c> tasks</c><00:04:31.919><c> that</c><00:04:32.000><c> you</c> thoughts it'll identify tasks that you thoughts it'll identify tasks that you need<00:04:32.280><c> to</c><00:04:32.440><c> do</c><00:04:33.199><c> and</c><00:04:33.680><c> then</c><00:04:34.680><c> down</c><00:04:34.880><c> the</c><00:04:35.039><c> line</c><00:04:35.360><c> we'll</c> need to do and then down the line we'll need to do and then down the line we'll actually<00:04:35.960><c> start</c><00:04:36.199><c> completing</c><00:04:36.600><c> them</c><00:04:36.759><c> for</c><00:04:37.000><c> you</c> actually start completing them for you actually start completing them for you as<00:04:37.440><c> it</c><00:04:38.400><c> learns</c><00:04:39.160><c> different</c><00:04:39.600><c> things</c><00:04:39.919><c> that</c><00:04:40.039><c> it</c> as it learns different things that it as it learns different things that it can<00:04:40.479><c> do</c><00:04:41.479><c> um</c><00:04:41.800><c> and</c><00:04:41.919><c> so</c><00:04:42.039><c> that's</c><00:04:42.199><c> going</c><00:04:42.280><c> to</c><00:04:42.360><c> be</c> can do um and so that's going to be can do um and so that's going to be pretty<00:04:42.639><c> cool</c><00:04:42.840><c> but</c><00:04:42.919><c> it's</c><00:04:43.039><c> going</c><00:04:43.120><c> to</c><00:04:43.199><c> be</c><00:04:43.320><c> a</c><00:04:43.440><c> great</c> pretty cool but it's going to be a great
