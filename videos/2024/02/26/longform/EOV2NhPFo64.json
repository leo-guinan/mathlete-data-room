for</c><00:01:16.840><c> a</c> each other and that is really bad for a each other and that is really bad for a Marketplace<00:01:18.520><c> so</c><00:01:19.439><c> today</c><00:01:19.840><c> I</c><00:01:19.920><c> wanted</c><00:01:20.159><c> to</c><00:01:20.320><c> take</c><00:01:20.439><c> a</c> Marketplace so today I wanted to take a Marketplace so today I wanted to take a look<00:01:20.920><c> at</c><00:01:21.360><c> what</c><00:01:21.720><c> the</c><00:01:22.479><c> ideal</c><00:01:22.960><c> Marketplace</c><00:01:23.520><c> would</c> look at what the ideal Marketplace would look at what the ideal Marketplace would look<00:01:24.079><c> like</c><00:01:24.920><c> from</c><00:01:25.159><c> the</c><00:01:25.360><c> standpoint</c><00:01:25.960><c> of</c><00:01:26.119><c> quantum</c> look like from the standpoint of quantum look like from the standpoint of quantum economics<00:01:28.880><c> and</c> economics and economics and to<00:01:30.720><c> do</c><00:01:30.960><c> that</c><00:01:31.159><c> we</c><00:01:31.240><c> need</c><00:01:31.400><c> to</c><00:01:31.520><c> kind</c><00:01:31.640><c> of</c><00:01:31.759><c> set</c><00:01:31.960><c> the</c> to do that we need to kind of set the to do that we need to kind of set the stage<00:01:32.799><c> right</c><00:01:33.799><c> and</c><00:01:34.040><c> so</c><00:01:35.000><c> let's</c><00:01:35.560><c> imagine</c><00:01:36.560><c> we've</c> stage right and so let's imagine we've stage right and so let's imagine we've got<00:01:36.880><c> a</c><00:01:37.159><c> Marketplace</c><00:01:38.159><c> and</c><00:01:38.880><c> in</c><00:01:39.079><c> this</c> got a Marketplace and in this got a Marketplace and in this Marketplace<00:01:40.280><c> we've</c><00:01:40.640><c> got</c><00:01:41.439><c> buyers</c><00:01:42.000><c> and</c><00:01:42.159><c> we've</c> Marketplace we've got buyers and we've Marketplace we've got buyers and we've got got got sellers<00:01:44.719><c> now</c><00:01:45.560><c> some</c><00:01:45.880><c> really</c><00:01:46.560><c> interesting</c> sellers now some really interesting sellers now some really interesting pricing<00:01:48.079><c> things</c><00:01:48.680><c> happen</c><00:01:49.680><c> when</c><00:01:50.079><c> you're</c><00:01:50.320><c> in</c><00:01:50.479><c> a</c> pricing things happen when you're in a pricing things happen when you're in a Marketplace<00:01:52.560><c> and</c><00:01:53.560><c> the</c><00:01:53.719><c> first</c><00:01:54.040><c> thing</c><00:01:54.439><c> is</c><00:01:54.680><c> that</c> Marketplace and the first thing is that Marketplace and the first thing is that prices<00:01:56.920><c> always</c><00:01:57.920><c> are</c><00:01:58.159><c> forced</c><00:01:58.840><c> downward</c><00:01:59.920><c> and</c> prices always are forced downward and prices always are forced downward and the<00:02:00.200><c> reason</c><00:02:00.479><c> for</c><00:02:00.759><c> this</c><00:02:01.320><c> is</c><00:02:01.840><c> that</c><00:02:02.840><c> the</c> the reason for this is that the the reason for this is that the marketplace<00:02:04.280><c> offers</c><00:02:05.280><c> more</c><00:02:05.640><c> selection</c><00:02:06.439><c> than</c> marketplace offers more selection than marketplace offers more selection than just<00:02:06.920><c> like</c><00:02:07.079><c> a</c><00:02:07.240><c> single</c><00:02:07.600><c> vender</c> just like a single vender just like a single vender right<00:02:10.160><c> now</c><00:02:11.160><c>

as</c><00:02:25.599><c> you</c> versus common goods whatever but as you versus common goods whatever but as you start<00:02:26.040><c> breaking</c><00:02:26.440><c> into</c><00:02:26.840><c> these</c><00:02:27.200><c> like</c><00:02:27.440><c> subsets</c> start breaking into these like subsets start breaking into these like subsets of<00:02:28.200><c> products</c><00:02:28.800><c> and</c><00:02:28.920><c> the</c><00:02:29.080><c> products</c><00:02:29.440><c> become</c> of products and the products become of products and the products become closer<00:02:30.200><c>

cold</c><00:03:56.280><c> start</c> that the whole reason for the cold start that the whole reason for the cold start problem<00:03:57.720><c> is</c><00:03:58.120><c> that</c><00:03:59.120><c> it's</c><00:03:59.319><c> focused</c><00:03:59.640><c> fing</c><00:03:59.959><c> on</c><00:04:00.840><c> a</c> problem is that it's focused fing on a problem is that it's focused fing on a recommendation<00:04:01.760><c> algorithm</c><00:04:02.680><c> as</c><00:04:02.879><c> the</c><00:04:03.040><c> basis</c> recommendation algorithm as the basis recommendation algorithm as the basis for for for Marketplace<00:04:06.760><c> but</c><00:04:06.959><c> that</c><00:04:07.239><c> actually</c><00:04:08.000><c> is</c><00:04:08.120><c> a</c><00:04:08.280><c> bad</c> Marketplace but that actually is a bad Marketplace but that actually is a bad idea idea idea because<00:04:11.519><c> the</c><00:04:12.840><c> algorithm</c><00:04:13.840><c> will</c><00:04:14.159><c> be</c><00:04:15.320><c> observable</c> because the algorithm will be observable because the algorithm will be observable by<00:04:16.560><c> the</c><00:04:16.759><c> participants</c><00:04:17.440><c> in</c><00:04:17.560><c> the</c> by the participants in the by the participants in the marketplace<00:04:19.400><c> but</c><00:04:19.560><c> it's</c><00:04:19.720><c> not</c><00:04:19.880><c> going</c><00:04:20.040><c> to</c><00:04:20.199><c> be</c> marketplace but it's not going to be marketplace but it's not going to be transparent<00:04:21.440><c> and</c><00:04:21.560><c> so</c><00:04:21.720><c> what</c><00:04:21.880><c> this</c><00:04:22.000><c> means</c><00:04:22.400><c> is</c> transparent and so what this means is transparent and so what this means is people<00:04:23.080><c> will</c><00:04:24.080><c> take</c><00:04:24.280><c> a</c><00:04:24.520><c> look</c><00:04:24.720><c> at</c><00:04:24.960><c> what's</c> people will take a look at what's people will take a look at what's getting<00:04:25.680><c> prioritized</c><00:04:26.639><c> by</c><00:04:26.800><c> the</c><00:04:27.040><c> algorithm</c><00:04:28.040><c> and</c> getting prioritized by the algorithm and getting prioritized by the algorithm and then<00:04:28.360><c> they</c><00:04:28.479><c> will</c><00:04:28.759><c> change</c><00:04:29.600><c> to</c><00:04:29.720><c> fit</c><00:04:30.000><c> the</c> then they will change to fit the then they will change to fit the algorithm<00:04:31.000><c> and</c><00:04:31.199><c> so</c><00:04:31.759><c> this</c><00:04:32.000><c> causes</c><00:04:32.680><c> people</c><00:04:33.080><c> to</c> algorithm and so this causes people to algorithm and so this causes people to overfit<00:04:35.240><c> the</c><00:04:35.479><c> marketplace</c><00:04:36.280><c> algorithm</c><00:04:37.280><c> which</c> overfit the marketplace algorithm which overfit the marketplace algorithm which then<00:04:38.000><c> takes</c><00:04:38.360><c> away</c><00:04:38.840><c> from</c><00:04:39.160><c> the</c><00:04:39.440><c> quality</c><00:04:40.120><c> of</c><00:04:40.880><c> the</c> then takes away from the quality of the then takes away from the quality of the products<00:04:41.360><c> or</c> products or products or services<00:04:43.199><c> and</c><00:04:43.919><c> that</c><00:04:44.160><c> leads</c><00:04:44.919><c> to</c><00:04:45.240><c> buyers</c><00:04:45.800><c> not</c> services and that leads to buyers not services and that leads to buyers not being<00:04:46.440><c>

we</c><00:06:36.599><c> want</c><00:06:36.720><c> to</c><00:06:36.880><c> do</c><00:06:37.080><c> here</c> and sellers so what we want to do here and sellers so what we want to do here is<00:06:37.440><c> we</c><00:06:37.599><c> actually</c><00:06:37.800><c> want</c><00:06:37.919><c> to</c><00:06:38.520><c> create</c><00:06:39.520><c> uh</c><00:06:39.680><c> a</c> is we actually

for getting people out of the optimize for getting people out of the marketplace<00:10:36.760><c> and</c><00:10:36.920><c> so</c><00:10:37.440><c> the</c><00:10:37.560><c> way</c><00:10:37.720><c> I</c><00:10:37.839><c> look</c><00:10:38.000><c> at</c><00:10:38.120><c> a</c> marketplace and so the way I look at a marketplace and so the way I look at a Marketplace<00:10:39.720><c> is</c><00:10:40.079><c> it</c><00:10:40.320><c> is</c><00:10:41.079><c> to</c><00:10:41.399><c> help</c><00:10:41.720><c> people</c><00:10:42.320><c> who</c> Marketplace is it is to help people who

for</c> don't have the connections they need for don't have the connections they need for like<00:10:46.839><c> long-term</c><00:10:47.279><c> relationships</c><00:10:47.839><c> to</c><00:10:48.000><c> find</c> like long-term relationships to find like long-term relationships to find those<00:10:49.000><c> relationships</c><00:10:49.920><c> build</c><00:10:50.200><c> them</c><00:10:50.360><c> out</c><00:10:51.360><c> and</c> those relationships build them out and those relationships build them out and take<00:10:52.519><c> them</c><00:10:52.680><c> outside</c><00:10:52.920><c> of</c><00:10:53.000><c> the</c><00:10:53.560><c> marketplace</c><00:10:54.560><c> and</c> take them outside of the marketplace and take them outside of the marketplace and so<00:10:55.560><c> I</c><00:10:55.680><c> view</c><00:10:55.920><c> the</c><00:10:56.000><c> marketplace</c><00:10:56.760><c> as</c><00:10:56.959><c> something</c> so I view the marketplace as
