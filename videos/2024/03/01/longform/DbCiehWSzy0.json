I</c><00:01:11.640><c> get</c><00:01:11.759><c> it</c><00:01:12.560><c> um</c><00:01:13.400><c> I</c><00:01:13.560><c> I</c> and yeah yeah I get it um I I and yeah yeah I get it um I I agree<00:01:15.520><c> and</c><00:01:15.640><c> that's</c><00:01:15.759><c> a</c><00:01:15.920><c> reason</c><00:01:16.240><c> that</c><00:01:16.560><c> EA</c><00:01:17.000><c> has</c> agree and that's a reason that EA has agree and that's a reason that EA has kind<00:01:17.280><c> of</c><00:01:17.520><c> gotten</c><00:01:17.960><c> a</c><00:01:18.119><c> bad</c><00:01:18.560><c> rap</c><00:01:19.560><c> and</c><00:01:19.960><c> so</c><00:01:20.640><c> they</c><00:01:20.759><c> are</c> kind of gotten a bad rap and so they are kind of gotten a bad rap and so they are definitely<00:01:21.360><c> against</c><00:01:21.720><c> things</c><00:01:22.040><c> like</c> definitely against things like definitely against things like existential<00:01:23.079><c> risk</c><00:01:23.720><c> and</c><00:01:24.280><c> any</c><00:01:24.479><c> sort</c><00:01:24.680><c> of</c> existential risk and any sort of existential risk and any sort of improvements<00:01:25.439><c> that</c><00:01:25.600><c> might</c><00:01:25.880><c> actually</c><00:01:26.360><c> help</c> improvements that might actually help improvements that might actually help people people people today<00:01:28.400><c> it's</c><00:01:28.520><c> not</c><00:01:28.680><c> entirely</c><00:01:29.040><c> fair</c><00:01:29.439><c> but</c> today it's not entirely fair but today it's not entirely fair but a<00:01:31.720><c> lot</c><00:01:31.840><c> of</c><00:01:32.000><c> people</c><00:01:32.399><c> actually</c><00:01:33.399><c> call</c><00:01:33.600><c> them</c> a lot of people actually call them a lot of people actually call them desels<00:01:34.399><c> as</c><00:01:34.560><c> well</c><00:01:35.560><c> um</c><00:01:35.960><c> which</c><00:01:36.159><c> is</c><00:01:36.439><c> the</c><00:01:37.000><c> opposite</c> desels as well um which is the opposite desels as well um which is the opposite of<00:01:37.680><c> the</c><00:01:38.040><c> eact</c><00:01:38.439><c> movement</c><00:01:38.799><c> which</c><00:01:38.880><c> is</c><00:01:39.040><c> effective</c> of the eact movement which is effective of the eact movement which is effective accelerationism<00:01:41.360><c> and</c><00:01:42.200><c> so</c><00:01:42.880><c> basically</c><00:01:43.280><c> their</c> accelerationism and so basically their accelerationism and so basically their argument<00:01:44.000><c> is</c><00:01:44.240><c> that</c><00:01:44.640><c> okay</c><00:01:45.000><c> the</c><00:01:45.280><c> EA</c><00:01:45.640><c> people</c><00:01:46.640><c> they</c> argument is that okay the EA people they argument is that okay the EA people they don't<00:01:46.920><c> know</c><00:01:47.000><c> what</c><00:01:47.079><c> they're</c><00:01:47.240><c> talking</c><00:01:47.680><c> about</c> don't know what they're talking about don't know what they're talking about the<00:01:49.000><c> answer</c><00:01:49.399><c> isn't</c><00:01:49.840><c> to</c><00:01:50.159><c> slow</c><00:01:50.520><c> down</c> the answer isn't to slow down the answer isn't to slow down development<00:01:51.119><c> and</c><00:01:51.280><c> make</c><00:01:51.399><c> sure</c><00:01:51.640><c> we</c><00:01:51.799><c> don't</c><00:01:52.520><c> ruin</c> development and make sure we don't ruin development and make sure we don't ruin the<00:01:52.920><c> world</c><00:01:53.040><c> for</c><00:01:53.159><c> everybody</c><00:01:53.439><c> else</c><00:01:53.719><c> it's</c><00:01:53.920><c> to</c> the world for everybody else it's to the world for everybody else it's to speed<00:01:54.399><c> up</c><00:01:54.560><c> technological</c><00:01:55.159><c> progress</c><00:01:55.560><c> because</c> speed up technological progress because speed up technological progress because that's<00:01:56.000><c> going</c><00:01:56.159><c> to</c><00:01:56.320><c> be</c><00:01:56.439><c> the</c><00:01:56.560><c> maximal</c><00:01:57.159><c> impactful</c> that's going to be the maximal impactful that's going to be the maximal impactful thing<00:01:58.759><c> that</c><00:01:58.920><c> will</c><00:01:59.840><c> ensure</c><00:02:00.159><c> the</c><00:02:00.240><c> future</c><00:02:00.439><c> of</c> thing that will ensure the future of thing that will ensure the future of humanity<00:02:01.200><c> and</c><00:02:01.399><c> so</c><00:02:02.320><c> technological</c> humanity and so technological humanity and so technological acceleration<00:02:04.039><c> at</c><00:02:04.200><c> all</c><00:02:04.439><c> costs</c><00:02:05.000><c> is</c><00:02:05.159><c> going</c><00:02:05.320><c> to</c><00:02:05.479><c> be</c> acceleration at all costs is going to be acceleration at all costs is going to be our<00:02:06.000><c> answer</c><00:02:06.600><c> out</c><00:02:06.759><c> of</c> this<00:02:10.840><c> okay</c> this okay this okay um<00:02:13.560><c> again</c><00:02:13.959><c>
