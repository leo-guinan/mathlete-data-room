of</c><00:00:48.000><c> the</c><00:00:48.120><c> issues</c><00:00:48.440><c> is</c><00:00:48.640><c> when</c> through but one of the issues is when through but one of the issues is when you<00:00:48.960><c> start</c><00:00:49.280><c> acting</c><00:00:49.719><c> like</c><00:00:50.480><c> you</c><00:00:50.680><c> just</c><00:00:50.920><c> know</c><00:00:51.160><c> what</c> you start acting like you just know what you start acting like you just know what you're<00:00:51.800><c> doing</c><00:00:52.800><c> people</c><00:00:53.320><c> start</c><00:00:53.559><c> following</c><00:00:54.239><c> and</c> you're doing people start following and you're doing people start following and that's<00:00:54.719><c> a</c><00:00:54.840><c> lot</c><00:00:54.920><c> of</c><00:00:55.039><c> pressure</c><00:00:55.480><c> sometimes</c><00:00:55.800><c> like</c> that's a lot of pressure sometimes like that's a lot of pressure sometimes like it<00:00:56.079><c> can</c><00:00:56.280><c> really</c><00:00:57.039><c> be</c><00:00:58.039><c> a</c><00:00:58.239><c> burden</c><00:00:59.000><c> and</c><00:00:59.079><c> so</c><00:00:59.199><c> you</c> it can really be a burden and so you it can really be a burden and so you might<00:00:59.440><c> hear</c><00:00:59.559><c> about</c><00:00:59.680><c> the</c><00:00:59.879><c> burden</c><00:01:00.120><c> of</c> might hear about the burden of might hear about the burden of leadership<00:01:01.800><c> and</c><00:01:02.600><c> it</c><00:01:02.760><c> can</c><00:01:03.440><c> really</c><00:01:03.680><c> take</c><00:01:03.840><c> a</c><00:01:04.199><c> toll</c> leadership and it can really take a toll leadership and it can really take a toll but<00:01:05.400><c> one</c><00:01:05.519><c> of</c><00:01:05.640><c> the</c><00:01:05.720><c> things</c><00:01:05.880><c> I've</c><00:01:06.080><c> really</c> but one of the things I've really but one of the things I've really focused<00:01:06.640><c> on</c><00:01:07.080><c> is</c><00:01:07.520><c> giving</c><00:01:07.920><c> people</c> focused on is giving people focused on is giving people choice<00:01:09.960><c> uh</c><00:01:10.119><c> I</c><00:01:10.240><c> I've</c><00:01:10.320><c> got</c><00:01:10.439><c> a</c><00:01:10.520><c> saying</c><00:01:10.880><c> that</c><00:01:11.040><c> keeps</c> choice uh I I've got a saying that keeps choice uh I I've got a saying that keeps just<00:01:11.600><c> repeating</c><00:01:11.960><c> in</c><00:01:12.080><c> my</c><00:01:12.240><c> head</c><00:01:12.479><c> over</c><00:01:12.640><c> and</c><00:01:12.799><c> over</c> just repeating in my head over and over just repeating in my head over and over again<00:01:13.280><c> so</c><00:01:13.479><c> choice</c><00:01:13.759><c> is</c><00:01:13.880><c> the</c><00:01:14.000><c> antidote</c><00:01:14.400><c> to</c><00:01:14.600><c> power</c> again so choice is the antidote to power again so choice is the antidote to power and<00:01:15.479><c> what</c><00:01:15.600><c> this</c><00:01:15.720><c> means</c><00:01:16.439><c> is</c><00:01:16.720><c> that</c><00:01:17.520><c> as</c><00:01:17.640><c> a</c><00:01:17.799><c> leader</c> and what this means is that as a leader and what this means is that as a leader like<00:01:18.720><c> I</c><00:01:18.880><c> can</c><00:01:19.400><c> not</c><00:01:19.720><c> have</c><00:01:19.840><c> to</c><00:01:19.960><c> worry</c><00:01:20.159><c> about</c> like I can not have to worry about like I can not have to worry about having<00:01:20.560><c> power</c><00:01:20.799><c> over</c><00:01:20.960><c> someone</c><00:01:21.200><c> if</c><00:01:21.280><c> they</c><00:01:21.400><c> have</c><00:01:21.479><c> a</c> having power over someone if they have a having power over someone if they have a choice<00:01:22.560><c> but</c><00:01:22.720><c> they</c><00:01:22.799><c> could</c><00:01:22.960><c> also</c><00:01:23.200><c> Follow</c><00:01:23.479><c> Me</c><00:01:23.680><c> by</c> choice but they could also Follow Me by choice but they could also Follow Me by choice<00:01:24.400><c> and</c><00:01:24.720><c> so</c><00:01:25.720><c> letting</c><00:01:26.000><c> leadership</c><00:01:26.520><c> be</c><00:01:26.680><c> a</c> choice and so letting leadership be a choice and so letting leadership be a choice<00:01:27.600><c> not</c><00:01:27.799><c> an</c><00:01:27.960><c> AC</c><00:01:28.159><c> of</c><00:01:28.400><c> power</c><00:01:29.240><c> is</c><00:01:29.479><c> actually</c><00:01:30.240><c> a</c> choice not an AC of power is actually a choice not an AC of power is actually a great<00:01:31.000><c> way</c><00:01:32.280><c> to</c><00:01:33.280><c> build</c><00:01:33.720><c> stronger</c> great way to build stronger great way to build stronger relationships<00:01:34.799><c> and</c><00:01:35.000><c> be</c><00:01:35.119><c> a</c><00:01:35.240><c> better</c><00:01:35.479><c> leader</c> relationships and be a better leader relationships and be a better leader power<00:01:36.640><c> dynamics</c><00:01:37.240><c> really</c><00:01:37.920><c>

because</c><00:01:41.399><c> it</c><00:01:41.640><c> makes</c> leadership can work because it makes leadership can work because it makes communication<00:01:42.600><c> a</c><00:01:42.720><c> lot</c><00:01:43.000><c> harder</c><00:01:44.000><c> and</c><00:01:44.520><c> if</c><00:01:44.640><c> you've</c> communication a lot harder and if you've communication a lot harder and if you've watched<00:01:45.159><c> some</c><00:01:45.280><c> of</c><00:01:45.360><c> my</c><00:01:45.520><c> other</c><00:01:45.640><c> videos</c><00:01:45.960><c> on</c> watched some of my other videos on watched some of my other videos on communication<00:01:47.560><c> um</c><00:01:47.960><c> that's</c><00:01:48.119><c> something</c><00:01:48.360><c> I</c><00:01:48.479><c> pay</c> communication um that's something I pay communication um that's something I pay a<00:01:48.719><c> lot</c><00:01:48.840><c> of</c><00:01:48.960><c> attention</c><00:01:49.320><c> to</c><00:01:50.040><c> and</c><00:01:50.439><c> power</c><00:01:50.719><c> dynamics</c> a lot of attention to and power dynamics a lot of attention to and power dynamics really<00:01:51.600><c> can</c><00:01:51.759><c> skew</c><00:01:52.200><c> that</c><00:01:52.479><c> because</c><00:01:53.280><c> if</c><00:01:53.439><c> somebody</c> really can skew that because if somebody really can skew that because if somebody can<00:01:54.040><c> fire</c><00:01:54.320><c> you</c><00:01:54.439><c> for</c><00:01:54.680><c> what</c><00:01:54.799><c> you</c> can fire you for what you can fire you for what you say<00:01:56.759><c> you</c><00:01:57.200><c> don't</c><00:01:58.079><c> speak</c><00:01:58.840><c> freely</c><00:01:59.960><c> you</c><00:02:00.119><c> just</c> say you don't speak freely you just say you don't speak freely you just can't<00:02:01.640><c> there</c><00:02:01.799><c> there's</c><00:02:01.960><c> too</c><00:02:02.119><c> much</c><00:02:02.320><c> risk</c> can't there there's too much risk can't there there's too much risk involved<00:02:03.360><c> and</c><00:02:03.479><c> so</c><00:02:03.920><c> pretty</c><00:02:04.079><c> much</c><00:02:04.280><c> everybody</c> involved and so pretty much everybody involved and so pretty much everybody won't<00:02:05.719><c> um</c><00:02:06.240><c> or</c><00:02:06.399><c> you</c><00:02:06.520><c> will</c><00:02:06.680><c> and</c><00:02:06.799><c> you'll</c><00:02:06.960><c> just</c><00:02:07.159><c> get</c> won't um or you will and you'll just get won't um or you will and you'll just get fired<00:02:07.719><c> and</c><00:02:08.440><c> you</c><00:02:08.560><c> know</c><00:02:08.840><c> then</c><00:02:08.959><c> it's</c><00:02:09.119><c> like</c><00:02:09.360><c> okay</c> fired and you know then it's like okay fired and you know then it's like okay well<00:02:10.119><c> cool</c><00:02:10.759><c> so</c><00:02:11.360><c> I've</c><00:02:11.480><c> been</c><00:02:11.599><c> really</c><00:02:11.800><c> trying</c><00:02:12.000><c> to</c> well cool so I've been really trying to well cool so I've been really trying to separate<00:02:12.520><c> this</c><00:02:12.720><c> idea</c><00:02:13.160><c> of</c><00:02:13.480><c> power</c><00:02:13.800><c> and</c> separate this idea of power and separate this idea of power and Leadership<00:02:15.239><c> because</c><00:02:16.000><c> I</c><00:02:16.080><c> think</c><00:02:16.280><c> it's</c> Leadership because I think it's Leadership because I think it's something<00:02:17.040><c> that</c><00:02:17.959><c> really</c><00:02:18.840><c> makes</c><00:02:19.200><c> everything</c><00:02:19.560><c> a</c> something that really makes everything a something that really makes everything a lot<00:02:19.879><c>
