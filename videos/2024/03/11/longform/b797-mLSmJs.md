rather how that concept is<00:00:34.280><c> actually</c><00:00:35.160><c> not</c><00:00:35.360><c> exactly</c><00:00:35.680><c> what</c><00:00:35.800><c> we</c><00:00:35.879><c> think</c><00:00:36.040><c> it</c> is actually not exactly what we think it is actually not exactly what we think it is<00:00:37.040><c> and</c><00:00:37.280><c> so</c><00:00:38.280><c> as</c><00:00:38.480><c> I've</c><00:00:38.640><c> set</c><00:00:39.040><c> a</c><00:00:39.399><c> mathematical</c> is and so as I've set a mathematical is and so as I've set a mathematical definition<00:00:40.280><c> of</c><00:00:40.399><c> intelligence</c><00:00:40.920><c> that</c><00:00:41.039><c> I'm</c> definition of intelligence that I'm definition of intelligence that I'm using<00:00:41.399><c> in</c><00:00:41.520><c> kind</c><00:00:41.640><c> of</c><00:00:41.760><c> my</c><00:00:41.879><c> AI</c><00:00:42.160><c> research</c><00:00:42.600><c> if</c><00:00:42.680><c> you</c> using in kind of my AI research if you using in kind of my AI research if you follow<00:00:43.160><c> that</c><00:00:43.280><c> at</c><00:00:43.559><c> all</c><00:00:44.559><c> I</c><00:00:44.719><c> wanted</c><00:00:45.160><c> to</c><00:00:46.160><c> see</c><00:00:46.559><c> how</c> follow that at all I wanted to see how follow that at all I wanted to see how he he he responded<00:00:49.719><c> trigger</c><00:00:50.039><c> warning</c> responded trigger warning responded trigger warning um<00:00:53.520><c> I'm</c><00:00:53.680><c> about</c><00:00:53.879><c> to</c><00:00:54.039><c> talk</c><00:00:54.160><c> about</c><00:00:54.600><c> math</c><00:00:55.600><c> or</c><00:00:55.840><c> maths</c> um I'm about to talk about math or maths um I'm about to talk about math or maths respecting<00:00:56.719><c> my</c><00:00:56.840><c> British</c><00:00:57.160><c> guest</c> respecting my British guest respecting my British guest here<00:00:59.960><c> so</c><00:01:00.559><c> I've</c><00:01:00.800><c> mathematically</c><00:01:01.280><c> defined</c><00:01:01.600><c> the</c> here so I've mathematically defined the here so I've mathematically defined the concept<00:01:01.960><c> of</c><00:01:02.079><c> intelligence</c><00:01:02.719><c> as</c><00:01:02.960><c> a</c><00:01:03.199><c> system</c><00:01:04.080><c> that</c> concept of intelligence as a system that concept of intelligence as a system that takes<00:01:04.640><c> a</c><00:01:05.199><c> an</c><00:01:05.400><c> input</c><00:01:06.400><c> uh</c><00:01:06.560><c> with</c><00:01:06.680><c> a</c><00:01:06.799><c> given</c><00:01:07.040><c> value</c> takes a an input uh with a given value takes a an input uh with a given value and<00:01:07.479><c> produces</c><00:01:07.880><c> an</c><00:01:08.040><c> output</c><00:01:08.439><c> of</c><00:01:08.560><c> a</c><00:01:08.720><c> higher</c><00:01:09.040><c> value</c> and produces an output of a higher value and produces an output of a higher value and<00:01:09.920><c> so</c><00:01:10.040><c> an</c><00:01:10.159><c> intelligent</c><00:01:10.640><c> system</c><00:01:10.920><c> is</c><00:01:11.080><c> one</c><00:01:11.240><c> that</c> and so an intelligent system is one that and so an intelligent system is one that adds<00:01:11.920><c> value</c><00:01:12.400><c> to</c><00:01:12.600><c> a</c><00:01:12.720><c> given</c><00:01:12.960><c> input</c><00:01:13.920><c> and</c><00:01:14.080><c> so</c><00:01:14.560><c> that</c> adds value to a given input and so that adds value to a given input and so that is<00:01:15.400><c> the</c><00:01:15.920><c> mathematical</c><00:01:16.680><c> definition</c><00:01:17.680><c> uh</c><00:01:17.799><c> that</c> is the mathematical definition uh that is the mathematical definition uh that we're<00:01:18.000><c> going</c><00:01:18.080><c> to</c><00:01:18.159><c> be</c><00:01:18.240><c> working</c><00:01:18.680><c> with</c> we're going to be working with we're going to be working with and<00:01:21.200><c> so</c><00:01:21.400><c> with</c><00:01:21.520><c> that</c><00:01:21.640><c> being</c><00:01:21.880><c> said</c><00:01:22.840><c> let's</c><00:01:23.040><c> go</c> and so with that being said let's go and so with that being said let's go ahead<00:01:23.280><c> and</c><00:01:23.320><c> get</c><00:01:23.439><c>

that intelligence does<00:01:39.079><c> exist</c><00:01:39.360><c> which</c><00:01:39.479><c> I've</c><00:01:39.640><c> been</c><00:01:40.159><c> kind</c><00:01:40.280><c> of</c><00:01:40.759><c> doing</c> does exist which I've been kind of doing does exist which I've been kind of doing from<00:01:42.079><c> my</c><00:01:42.240><c> early</c><00:01:42.600><c> University</c><00:01:43.159><c> days</c><00:01:44.000><c> uh</c><00:01:44.119><c> it's</c> from my early University days uh it's from my early University days uh it's just<00:01:44.479><c> that</c><00:01:44.719><c> the</c><00:01:45.079><c> the</c><00:01:45.600><c> book</c><00:01:45.880><c> takes</c><00:01:46.119><c> a</c><00:01:46.200><c> lot</c> just that the the book takes a lot just that the the book takes a

you actually start looking at<00:01:47.880><c> concepts</c><00:01:48.200><c> of</c><00:01:48.399><c> intelligence</c><00:01:49.399><c> uh</c><00:01:49.680><c> which</c><00:01:49.799><c> is</c> at concepts of intelligence uh which is at concepts of intelligence uh which is kind<00:01:50.079><c> of</c><00:01:50.200><c> the</c><00:01:50.320><c> point</c><00:01:50.560><c> I</c><00:01:50.680><c>

mathematics and programming that just mathematics and programming that just means<00:08:47.160><c> you're</c><00:08:47.440><c> continually</c><00:08:48.040><c> having</c><00:08:48.240><c>

that</c><00:08:57.200><c> that's</c><00:08:57.480><c> um</c><00:08:57.880><c> so</c><00:08:58.240><c> that's</c><00:08:58.399><c> really</c> that that that's um so that's really that that that's um so

a</c><00:09:04.320><c> system</c><00:09:04.839><c> and</c><00:09:05.040><c> so</c><00:09:06.040><c> um</c><00:09:06.720><c> we</c> like defined by a system and so um we like defined by a system and so

there's stuff that's outside the then there's stuff that's outside the system<00:09:15.279><c> and</c><00:09:15.360><c> so</c><00:09:15.560><c> intelligence</c><00:09:16.040><c> is</c><00:09:16.200><c> really</c><00:09:16.399><c> a</c> system and so intelligence is really a system and so intelligence is really a combination<00:09:17.519><c> of</c><00:09:18.120><c> you</c><00:09:18.240><c> know</c><00:09:18.600><c> the</c><00:09:18.920><c> the</c> combination of you know the the combination of you know the the individual<00:09:19.640><c> so</c><00:09:19.880><c>

then</c><00:15:41.639><c> we</c> this and we keep doing that and then we this and we keep doing that and then we structure<00:15:42.079><c> it</c><00:15:42.240><c> again</c><00:15:42.399><c> to</c><00:15:42.639><c> that</c><00:15:42.880><c> and</c><00:15:43.399><c> that's</c> structure it again to that and that's structure it again to that and that's the<00:15:43.759><c>

the problem that we get into is that every<00:15:45.959><c> time</c><00:15:46.160><c> we</c><00:15:46.319><c> Define</c><00:15:46.680><c> it</c><00:15:47.440><c> it</c><00:15:47.600><c>

I</c><00:23:45.039><c> think</c><00:23:45.200><c> it</c><00:23:45.320><c> was</c><00:23:46.039><c> and</c> Paleolithic Era I think it was and Paleolithic Era I think it was and essentially<00:23:47.440><c> he</c><00:23:47.640><c> has</c><00:23:47.960><c> degrees</c><00:23:48.960><c> in</c><00:23:49.200><c> kind</c><00:23:49.360><c> of</c> essentially he has degrees in kind of essentially he has degrees in kind of everything<00:23:50.760><c> but</c><00:23:51.480><c> his</c><00:23:51.960><c> knowledge</c><00:23:53.200><c> is</c><00:23:54.200><c> he</c><00:23:54.320><c> could</c> everything but his knowledge is he could everything but his knowledge is he could have<00:23:54.559><c> a</c><00:23:54.679><c> doctorate</c><00:23:55.080><c> in</c><00:23:55.679><c> everything</c><00:23:56.480><c> but</c><00:23:56.600><c> the</c> have a doctorate in everything but the have a doctorate in everything but the problem<00:23:56.880><c> is</c><00:23:56.960><c> that</c><00:23:57.039><c> was</c><00:23:57.240><c> 100</c><00:23:57.400><c> years</c><00:23:57.559><c> ago</c><00:23:57.760><c> that</c> problem is that was 100 years ago that problem is that was 100 years ago that that<00:23:57.960><c> was</c><00:23:58.600><c> 50</c><00:23:58.880><c> years</c><00:23:59.000><c> ago</c><00:23:59.320><c> 20</c><00:23:59.600><c> years</c><00:23:59.760><c> ago</c><00:24:00.320><c> and</c> that was 50 years ago 20 years ago and that was 50 years ago 20 years ago and so<00:24:00.799><c> that's</c><00:24:01.039><c> consistently</c><00:24:01.760><c> changing</c><00:24:02.360><c> as</c><00:24:02.520><c> well</c> so that's consistently changing as well so that's consistently changing as well so<00:24:02.880><c> even</c><00:24:03.039><c> when</c><00:24:03.159><c> you</c><00:24:03.240><c> have</c><00:24:03.360><c> the</c><00:24:03.480><c> parameters</c><00:24:04.200><c> the</c> so even when you have the parameters the so even when you have the parameters the parameters<00:24:04.799><c> constantly</c><00:24:05.200><c> change</c><00:24:05.600><c> that's</c><00:24:05.840><c> why</c> parameters constantly change that's why parameters constantly change that's why you<00:24:06.440><c> don't</c><00:24:06.640><c> necessarily</c><00:24:07.000><c> want</c><00:24:07.440><c> your</c><00:24:07.720><c> doctor</c> you don't necessarily want

of<00:24:36.080><c> the</c><00:24:36.240><c> class</c><00:24:36.640><c> he</c><00:24:36.760><c> was</c><00:24:37.440><c> midway</c><00:24:38.440><c> and</c><00:24:38.600><c> so</c><00:24:39.360><c> I</c> of the class he was midway and so I of the class he was midway and so I think<00:24:39.760><c> that</c><00:24:40.039><c> the</c><00:24:40.279><c> the</c><00:24:40.399><c> interweaving</c><00:24:41.080><c> of</c><00:24:41.240><c> how</c> think that the the interweaving of how think that the the interweaving of how we<00:24:41.480><c> see</c><00:24:41.720><c> things</c><00:24:42.039><c> becomes</c><00:24:43.039><c> the</c><00:24:43.279><c> problem</c><00:24:43.720><c> and</c> we see things becomes the problem and we see things becomes the problem and then<00:24:44.240><c> again</c><00:24:44.559><c> that's</c><00:24:45.200><c> why</c><00:24:46.200><c> in</c><00:24:46.399><c> in</c><00:24:46.480><c> my</c><00:24:46.640><c> book</c><00:24:46.840><c> I</c> then again that's why in in my book I then again that's why in in my book I talk<00:24:47.159><c> about</c><00:24:47.279><c> the</c><00:24:47.360><c> fact</c><00:24:47.520><c>

out</c><00:28:50.000><c> how</c> need to do is figure out how need to do is figure out how to<00:28:51.840><c> make</c><00:28:52.039><c> sure</c><00:28:52.320><c> we</c><00:28:52.480><c>

very specific systems<00:29:21.200><c> right</c><00:29:21.960><c> but</c><00:29:22.120><c> then</c><00:29:22.200><c> we</c><00:29:22.399><c> like</c><00:29:22.640><c> kind</c><00:29:22.760><c> of</c> systems right but then we like kind of systems right but then we like kind of just<00:29:23.440><c> break</c><00:29:23.760><c> them</c><00:29:23.960><c> apart</c><00:29:24.440><c> and</c><00:29:24.840><c> really</c><00:29:25.320><c> like</c><00:29:26.039><c> go</c> just break them apart and really like go just break them apart and really like go deep<00:29:26.720><c> and</c><00:29:27.000><c> you</c><00:29:27.080><c> know</c><00:29:27.399><c> deeper</c><00:29:27.600><c> and</c><00:29:27.679><c> deeper</c><00:29:27.919><c> and</c> deep and you know deeper and deeper and deep and you know deeper and deeper and deeper<00:29:29.039><c> and</c><00:29:29.200><c> so</c><00:29:29.760><c> there's</c><00:29:30.000><c> all</c><00:29:30.240><c> these</c><00:29:30.519><c>

it</c><00:29:38.480><c> out</c><00:29:38.679><c> and</c><00:29:38.799><c> hit</c><00:29:38.960><c> the</c><00:29:39.080><c> real</c> when we break it out and hit the real when we break it out and hit

the the the structure<00:30:15.840><c> that</c><00:30:15.919><c> we</c><00:30:16.120><c> then</c><00:30:16.240><c> move</c><00:30:16.519><c> forward</c><00:30:16.840><c> in</c> structure that we then move forward in structure that we then move forward in yeah<00:30:17.360><c> yes</c><00:30:17.679><c> yeah</c><00:30:17.799><c> so</c><00:30:17.960><c> that's</c><00:30:18.200><c>

that<00:30:20.360><c> um</c><00:30:21.360><c> I've</c><00:30:21.480><c> kind</c><00:30:21.600><c> of</c><00:30:21.720><c> explored</c><00:30:22.080><c> too</c><00:30:22.679><c> is</c><00:30:22.919><c> by</c> that um I've kind of explored too is by that um I've kind of explored too is by defining<00:30:23.440><c> the</c> defining the defining the structure<00:30:25.480><c> by</c><00:30:25.640><c> definition</c><00:30:26.320><c> anything</c><00:30:26.600><c> outside</c> structure by definition anything outside structure by definition anything outside of<00:30:26.960><c> thatu</c><00:30:27.320><c> structure</c><00:30:27.880><c> becomes</c><00:30:28.360><c> unimportant</c> of thatu structure becomes unimportant of thatu structure becomes unimportant and<00:30:29.000><c> ignored</c><00:30:29.480><c> because</c><00:30:29.640><c> it</c><00:30:29.720><c> can't</c><00:30:29.880><c> fit</c><00:30:30.080><c> into</c> and ignored because it can't fit

up</c><00:30:31.919><c> these</c> the structure and so we set up these the structure and so we set up these very<00:30:32.440><c> very</c><00:30:32.799><c> like</c><00:30:33.279><c> rigid</c><00:30:33.679><c> structures</c><00:30:34.360><c> to</c><00:30:34.880><c> like</c> very very like rigid structures to like very very like rigid structures to like enhance<00:30:36.000><c> the</c><00:30:36.159><c> efficiency</c><00:30:36.519><c> of</c><00:30:37.080><c> communication</c> enhance the efficiency of communication enhance the efficiency of communication but<00:30:38.200><c> it's</c><00:30:38.440><c> actually</c><00:30:39.440><c> less</c><00:30:39.720><c> efficient</c><00:30:40.039><c> in</c><00:30:40.159><c> a</c> but it's actually less efficient in a but it's actually

the</c><00:38:02.760><c> stuff</c><00:38:02.960><c> that</c><00:38:03.119><c> I</c><00:38:03.240><c> was</c><00:38:03.400><c> taught</c> was not in the stuff that I was taught was not in the stuff that I was taught to<00:38:03.839><c> rigidly</c><00:38:04.240><c> think</c><00:38:04.400><c> about</c><00:38:04.680><c> in</c><00:38:04.760><c> order</c><00:38:05.000><c> to</c> to rigidly think

because</c><00:38:08.280><c> that</c> achieve a certain grade um because that achieve a certain grade um because that that<00:38:08.720><c> that</c><00:38:08.920><c> play</c><00:38:09.319><c> like</c><00:38:09.560><c> I</c><00:38:09.720><c> had</c><00:38:10.040><c> no</c><00:38:10.359><c> expectation</c> that that play like I had no expectation that that play like I had no expectation of<00:38:11.240><c> a</c><00:38:11.440><c> result</c><00:38:12.200><c> and</c><00:38:12.319><c> I</c><00:38:12.440><c> think</c><00:38:13.000><c> that's</c><00:38:13.160><c> the</c> of a result and I think that's the of a result and I think that's the interesting<00:38:13.720><c> thing</c><00:38:13.880><c> about</c><00:38:14.200><c> play</c> interesting thing about play interesting thing about play because<00:38:17.160><c> it's</c><00:38:18.160><c> wandering</c><00:38:19.079><c> without</c><00:38:19.359><c> a</c><00:38:19.560><c> set</c> because it's wandering without a set because it's wandering without a set path<00:38:20.640><c> there's</c><00:38:20.760><c> a</c><00:38:20.880><c> book</c><00:38:21.000><c> I</c><00:38:21.079><c> like</c><00:38:21.240><c> called</c><00:38:21.359><c> the</c> path there's a book I like called the path there's a book I like called the path<00:38:21.599><c> is</c><00:38:21.839><c> path</c><00:38:22.079><c> which</c><00:38:22.240><c> essentially</c><00:38:22.680><c> I</c><00:38:22.760><c> think</c> path is path which essentially I think path is path which essentially I think puts<00:38:23.599><c> a</c><00:38:23.680><c> lot</c><00:38:23.800><c> of</c><00:38:23.920><c> that</c><00:38:24.079><c> just</c><00:38:24.240><c> into</c><00:38:25.160><c> the</c><00:38:25.240><c> way</c><00:38:25.400><c> you</c> puts a lot of that just into the way you puts a lot of that just into the way you live<00:38:26.240><c> but</c><00:38:26.359><c> the</c><00:38:26.640><c> that</c><00:38:26.800><c> that's</c><00:38:26.920><c> the</c><00:38:27.079><c> concept</c><00:38:27.359><c> of</c> live but the that that's the concept of live but the that that's the concept of play<00:38:27.720><c> to</c><00:38:27.839><c> me</c><00:38:28.079><c> and</c><00:38:28.160><c> so</c><00:38:28.560><c> that</c><00:38:28.800><c> I</c><00:38:29.040><c> think</c><00:38:30.040><c> really</c> play to me and so that I think really play to me and so that I think really helps<00:38:30.480><c> you</c><00:38:30.960><c> understand</c><00:38:31.240><c> first</c><00:38:31.440><c> of</c><00:38:31.560><c> all</c><00:38:31.880><c> like</c> helps you understand first of all like helps you understand first of all like what<00:38:32.560><c> systems</c><00:38:32.920><c> you</c><00:38:33.040><c> perform</c><00:38:33.400><c> well</c><00:38:33.599><c> in</c><00:38:34.119><c> right</c> what systems you perform well in right what systems you perform well in right and<00:38:34.720><c> so</c><00:38:35.560><c> because</c><00:38:35.720><c> there's</c><00:38:35.880><c> there's</c><00:38:36.000><c> so</c><00:38:36.119><c> much</c> and so because there's there's so much and so because there's there's so much that<00:38:36.319><c> goes</c><00:38:36.480><c> into</c><00:38:36.800><c> like</c><00:38:36.960><c> even</c><00:38:37.200><c> just</c><00:38:37.359><c> playing</c><00:38:37.599><c> a</c> that goes into like even just playing a that goes into like even just playing a sport<00:38:38.200><c> right</c><00:38:38.680><c> because</c><00:38:38.880><c> you</c><00:38:38.960><c> have</c><00:38:39.079><c> all</c><00:38:39.200><c> these</c> sport right because you have all these sport right because you have all these interactions<00:38:39.880><c> with</c><00:38:40.079><c> the</c><00:38:40.280><c>

um</c><00:38:42.240><c> you</c><00:38:42.319><c> know</c><00:38:42.480><c> there's</c> on the team um you know there's on the team um you know there's different<00:38:43.040><c> positions</c><00:38:43.480><c> you</c><00:38:43.599><c> can</c><00:38:43.800><c> play</c><00:38:43.960><c> and</c><00:38:44.079><c> see</c> different positions you can play and see different positions you can play and see the<00:38:44.440><c> field</c><00:38:44.760><c> from</c><00:38:44.960><c> different</c><00:38:45.560><c> places</c><00:38:46.359><c> you've</c> the field from different places you've the field from different places you've got<00:38:46.760><c> different</c><00:38:47.040><c> styles</c><00:38:47.359><c> of</c><00:38:47.520><c> coaching</c><00:38:48.040><c> that</c> got different styles of coaching that got different styles of coaching that can<00:38:48.319><c> play</c><00:38:48.520><c> into</c><00:38:48.800><c> that</c><00:38:49.119><c> right</c><00:38:49.400><c> absolutely</c><00:38:50.040><c> and</c> can play into that right absolutely and can play into that right absolutely and so<00:38:50.720><c> it's</c><00:38:50.920><c> not</c><00:38:51.079><c> a</c><00:38:51.280><c> matter</c><00:38:51.720><c> of</c><00:38:52.000><c> finding</c><00:38:52.440><c> the</c><00:38:52.680><c> best</c> so it's not a matter of finding the best so it's not a matter

uh as you<00:44:09.680><c> were</c><00:44:09.880><c> talking</c><00:44:10.280><c> the</c><00:44:10.400><c> idea</c><00:44:10.680><c> of</c><00:44:10.839><c> fun</c><00:44:11.200><c> popped</c> you were talking the idea of fun popped you were talking the idea of fun popped in<00:44:11.599><c> and</c><00:44:11.800><c> like</c><00:44:12.200><c> how</c><00:44:12.319><c> would</c><00:44:12.440><c> I</c><00:44:12.599><c> Define</c><00:44:12.960><c> that</c><00:44:13.160><c> kind</c> in and like how would I Define that kind in and like how would I Define that kind of<00:44:13.480><c> within</c><00:44:13.760><c> my</c><00:44:13.920><c> mathematical</c><00:44:14.400><c> model</c><00:44:14.760><c> right</c> of within my mathematical model right of within my mathematical model right like<00:44:14.960><c> how</c><00:44:15.040><c> do</c><00:44:15.160><c> you</c><00:44:15.280><c> define</c><00:44:15.760><c> fun</c><00:44:16.760><c> um</c><00:44:17.640><c> and</c><00:44:17.800><c> fun</c><00:44:18.119><c> I</c> like how do you define fun um and fun I like how do you define fun um and fun I actually<00:44:18.520><c> think</c><00:44:18.880><c> can</c><00:44:19.040><c> be</c><00:44:19.240><c> defined</c><00:44:20.480><c> as</c><00:44:21.480><c> a</c> actually think can be defined as a actually think can be defined as a solely<00:44:22.520><c> like</c><00:44:23.160><c> internal</c><00:44:23.800><c> valuation</c><00:44:24.280><c> function</c> solely like internal valuation function solely like internal valuation function right<00:44:25.000><c> so</c><00:44:25.680><c> fun</c><00:44:26.200><c> is</c><00:44:26.319><c> something</c><00:44:26.680><c> that</c><00:44:26.800><c> is</c> right so fun is something that is right so fun is something that is entirely<00:44:27.880><c> for</c><00:44:28.359><c> you</c><00:44:28.839><c> that</c><00:44:29.160><c> like</c><00:44:29.640><c> you</c><00:44:30.040><c> enjoy</c> entirely for you that like you enjoy entirely for you that like you enjoy personally<00:44:32.200><c> um</c><00:44:33.200><c> and</c><00:44:33.280><c> so</c><00:44:33.520><c> anything</c><00:44:33.839><c> beyond</c> personally um and so anything beyond personally um and so anything beyond that<00:44:34.640><c> is</c><00:44:34.839><c> like</c><00:44:35.000><c> so</c><00:44:35.240><c> so</c><00:44:35.400><c> that's</c><00:44:35.520><c> the</c><00:44:35.640><c> outcome</c> that is like so so that's the outcome that is like so so that's the outcome right<00:44:36.079><c> it's</c><00:44:36.200><c> just</c><00:44:36.440><c> doing</c><00:44:36.760><c> something</c><00:44:37.160><c> that</c><00:44:37.280><c> you</c> right it's just doing something that you right it's just doing something that you enjoy<00:44:39.040><c> um</c><00:44:40.040><c> and</c> enjoy um and enjoy um and so<00:44:41.880><c> that</c><00:44:42.079><c> has</c><00:44:42.280><c> me</c><00:44:42.520><c>

build<00:44:45.680><c> an</c><00:44:45.800><c> AI</c><00:44:46.200><c> system</c><00:44:46.839><c> that</c><00:44:47.040><c> can</c><00:44:47.760><c> have</c><00:44:48.240><c> fun</c><00:44:49.240><c> in</c> build an AI system that can have fun in build an AI system that can have fun in terms<00:44:49.839><c> of</c><00:44:50.440><c> taking</c><00:44:50.760><c> an</c><00:44:51.000><c> input</c><00:44:51.800><c> and</c><00:44:52.079><c> just</c><00:44:52.440><c> trying</c> terms of taking an input and just trying terms of taking an input and just trying to<00:44:55.079><c> do</c><00:44:55.319><c> a</c><00:44:55.400><c> bunch</c><00:44:55.559><c> of</c><00:44:55.680><c> random</c><00:44:56.280><c> things</c><00:44:56.800><c> that</c><00:44:57.200><c> it</c> to do a bunch of random things that it to do a bunch of random things that it seems<00:44:59.240><c> to</c><00:44:59.520><c> think</c><00:44:59.800><c> of</c><00:45:00.240><c> and</c><00:45:00.440><c> letting</c><00:45:00.760><c> it</c><00:45:01.720><c> play</c><00:45:02.720><c> um</c> seems to think of and letting it play um seems to think of and letting it play um and<00:45:03.119><c> so</c><00:45:03.400><c> that</c><00:45:03.520><c> might</c><00:45:03.640><c> be</c><00:45:03.760><c> an</c><00:45:03.880><c> experiment</c><00:45:04.200><c> that</c> and so that might be an experiment that and so that might be an experiment that I'll<00:45:04.400><c> be</c><00:45:04.480><c> launching</c><00:45:04.800><c> soon</c><00:45:05.400><c> um</c><00:45:05.800><c> because</c><00:45:06.079><c> now</c> I'll be launching soon um because now I'll be launching soon um because now I'm<00:45:06.319><c> really</c><00:45:06.520><c> curious</c><00:45:06.880><c> because</c><00:45:07.000><c> as</c><00:45:07.119><c> I</c><00:45:07.200><c> was</c> I'm really curious because as I was I'm really curious because as I was thinking<00:45:07.520><c> about</c><00:45:07.640><c> this</c><00:45:07.800><c> I</c><00:45:07.880><c> was</c><00:45:07.960><c> like</c><00:45:08.119><c> oh</c> thinking about this I was like oh thinking about this I was like oh actually<00:45:08.480><c> we</c><00:45:08.559><c> could</c><00:45:08.920><c> kind</c><00:45:09.079><c> of</c><00:45:09.359><c> Define</c><00:45:09.839><c> fun</c><00:45:10.240><c> in</c> actually we could kind of Define fun in actually we could kind of Define fun in this<00:45:10.720><c> model</c><00:45:11.720><c> and</c><00:45:12.079><c> that</c><00:45:12.240><c> means</c><00:45:12.680><c> that</c><00:45:12.880><c> we</c><00:45:13.040><c> can</c> this model and that means that we can this model and that means that we can build<00:45:13.640><c> it</c><00:45:14.640><c> um</c><00:45:15.160><c> so</c><00:45:15.480><c> yes</c><00:45:15.800><c> that</c><00:45:15.920><c> is</c><00:45:16.240><c> a</c><00:45:17.240><c> that's</c> build it um so yes that is a that's build it um so yes that is a that's going<00:45:17.520><c> to</c><00:45:17.640><c> be</c><00:45:17.760><c> fun</c><00:45:18.640><c> um</c><00:45:19.480><c> regardless</c><00:45:20.079><c> of</c><00:45:20.400><c> whether</c> going to be fun um regardless of whether going to be fun um regardless of whether it<00:45:20.640><c> turns</c><00:45:20.880><c> out</c><00:45:21.119><c> because</c><00:45:21.599><c> I'm</c><00:45:21.800><c> interested</c><00:45:22.200><c> in</c> it turns out because I'm interested in it turns out because I'm interested in it<00:45:22.559><c> so</c><00:45:23.040><c> I'm</c><00:45:23.240><c> going</c><00:45:23.440><c> to</c><00:45:23.599><c> play</c><00:45:23.839><c> with</c><00:45:23.960><c> it</c><00:45:24.680><c> I</c><00:45:24.880><c> me</c><00:45:26.079><c>

the</c><00:46:24.960><c> tradition</c><00:46:25.319><c> that</c> fun is according to the tradition that fun is according to the tradition that they<00:46:25.559><c> are</c><00:46:25.640><c>

think</c><00:46:59.079><c> and</c><00:46:59.480><c> um</c> very early on actually I think and um very early on actually I think and um something<00:47:00.599><c> that</c><00:47:00.760><c> people</c><00:47:00.960><c> have</c><00:47:01.079><c> struggled</c> something that people have struggled something that people have struggled with<00:47:01.839><c> because</c><00:47:02.839><c>

right next some of that research all right next question<00:48:30.000><c> also</c><00:48:30.240><c> from</c><00:48:30.640><c> Sabrina</c><00:48:31.640><c> um</c><00:48:32.079><c> I</c><00:48:32.160><c> think</c><00:48:32.280><c> it</c> question also from Sabrina um I think it question also from Sabrina um I think it would<00:48:32.440><c> be</c><00:48:32.559><c> a</c><00:48:32.680><c> good</c><00:48:33.240><c> uh</c><00:48:33.440><c> thing</c><00:48:33.640><c> to</c><00:48:33.760><c> fit</c><00:48:33.920><c> in</c><00:48:34.079><c> here</c> would be a good uh thing to fit in here would be a good uh thing to fit in here so<00:48:35.319><c> um</c><00:48:36.040><c> are</c><00:48:36.160><c> there</c><00:48:36.319><c> any</c><00:48:36.440><c> keys</c><00:48:36.680><c> to</c><00:48:36.800><c> unlocking</c> so um are there any keys to unlocking so um are there any keys to unlocking like<00:48:37.680><c> new</c><00:48:37.880><c> Realms</c><00:48:38.200><c> of</c><00:48:38.319><c> intelligence</c><00:48:38.800><c> and</c><00:48:38.920><c> I</c> like new Realms of intelligence and I like new Realms of intelligence and I think<00:48:39.119><c> we've</c><00:48:39.280><c> kind</c><00:48:39.400><c> of</c><00:48:39.520><c> touched</c><00:48:39.800><c> on</c><00:48:39.880><c> the</c><00:48:40.040><c> fact</c> think we've kind of touched on the fact think we've kind of touched on the fact that<00:48:40.680><c> it's</c><00:48:40.800><c> a</c><00:48:40.880><c> really</c><00:48:41.000><c> hard</c><00:48:41.119><c> thing</c><00:48:41.240><c> to</c><00:48:41.319><c> Define</c> that it's a really hard thing to Define that it's a really hard thing to Define anyway<00:48:42.400><c> so</c><00:48:43.400><c> we</c><00:48:43.480><c> can</c><00:48:43.599><c> make</c><00:48:43.760><c> it</c><00:48:43.880><c> up</c><00:48:44.160><c> and</c><00:48:44.319><c> at</c><00:48:44.440><c> least</c> anyway so we can make it up and at least anyway so we can make it up and at least say<00:48:45.040><c> that</c><00:48:45.400><c> um</c><00:48:45.839><c> you</c><00:48:45.960><c> know</c><00:48:46.119><c> kind</c><00:48:46.240><c> of</c><00:48:46.599><c> with</c><00:48:46.720><c> my</c> say that um you know kind of with my say that um you know kind of with my definition<00:48:47.240><c> of</c><00:48:47.359><c> it</c><00:48:47.559><c> it</c><00:48:47.640><c> would</c><00:48:47.800><c> be</c><00:48:48.720><c> um</c><00:48:49.079><c> the</c> definition of it it would be um the definition of it it would be um the creation<00:48:49.480><c> of</c><00:48:49.599><c> a</c><00:48:49.680><c> new</c><00:48:49.880><c> system</c><00:48:50.359><c> and</c><00:48:50.480><c> so</c><00:48:50.640><c> a</c><00:48:50.799><c> system</c> creation of a new system and so a system creation of a new system and so a system is<00:48:51.559><c> what</c><00:48:51.680><c> you</c><00:48:51.839><c> define</c><00:48:52.079><c> it</c><00:48:52.280><c> as</c><00:48:53.000><c> and</c><00:48:53.160><c> so</c><00:48:53.440><c> when</c><00:48:53.680><c> you</c> is what you

because<00:55:01.079><c> it's</c><00:55:01.200><c> something</c><00:55:01.400><c> that's</c><00:55:01.559><c> going</c><00:55:01.799><c> to</c> because it's something that's going to because it's

my</c><00:55:11.559><c> videos</c><00:55:12.319><c> go</c><00:55:12.440><c> watch</c><00:55:12.599><c> all</c><00:55:12.720><c> of</c> another one of my videos go watch all of another one of my videos go watch all of them<00:55:13.240><c> um</c><00:55:13.440><c> there's</c><00:55:13.720><c> time</c><00:55:14.720><c> um</c><00:55:15.720><c> is</c><00:55:15.920><c> that</c><00:55:16.200><c> I</c><00:55:16.319><c> think</c> them um there's time um is that I think them um there's time um is that I think the<00:55:18.000><c> uh</c><00:55:18.359><c> like</c><00:55:18.520><c> the</c><00:55:18.680><c> body</c><00:55:19.160><c> actually</c><00:55:20.119><c> knows</c> the uh like the body actually knows the uh like the body actually knows things<00:55:20.720><c> well</c><00:55:20.920><c> before</c><00:55:21.160><c> the</c><00:55:21.280><c> mind</c><00:55:22.119><c> um</c><00:55:22.920><c> and</c><00:55:23.240><c> so</c> things well before the mind um and so things well before the mind um and so you<00:55:24.359><c> kind</c><00:55:24.440><c> of</c><00:55:24.559><c> think</c><00:55:24.680><c> of</c><00:55:24.799><c> this</c><00:55:25.119><c> like</c><00:55:25.319><c> trusting</c> you kind of think of this like trusting you kind of think of this like trusting your<00:55:26.079><c> gut</c><00:55:27.079><c> and</c><00:55:27.559><c> so</c><00:55:28.240><c> I</c><00:55:28.359><c> like</c><00:55:28.559><c> the</c><00:55:28.720><c> idea</c><00:55:29.039><c> of</c> your gut and so I like the idea of your gut and so I like the idea of trusting<00:55:29.640><c> your</c><00:55:29.920><c> gut</c><00:55:30.880><c> as</c><00:55:30.960><c> a</c><00:55:31.160><c> way</c> trusting your gut as a way trusting your gut as a way to<00:55:33.240><c> um</c><00:55:33.799><c> trigger</c><00:55:34.240><c> curiosity</c><00:55:34.720><c> and</c><00:55:35.280><c> exploration</c> to um trigger curiosity and exploration to um trigger curiosity and exploration and<00:55:37.000><c> so</c><00:55:38.000><c> if</c><00:55:38.079><c> you</c><00:55:38.280><c> have</c><00:55:38.400><c> a</c><00:55:38.559><c> hunch</c><00:55:39.559><c> that</c> and so if you have a hunch that and so if you have a hunch that something<00:55:40.000><c> is</c><00:55:40.200><c> interesting</c><00:55:40.839><c> and</c><00:55:41.039><c> you</c><00:55:41.200><c> can't</c> something is interesting and you can't something is interesting and you can't quite<00:55:41.559><c> put</c><00:55:41.680><c> your</c><00:55:41.799><c> finger</c><00:55:42.000><c> on</c><00:55:42.160><c> it</c><00:55:42.920><c> go</c><00:55:43.119><c> play</c><00:55:43.319><c> with</c> quite put your finger on it go play with quite put your finger on it go play with it<00:55:44.359><c> go</c><00:55:44.599><c> play</c><00:55:45.079><c> and</c><00:55:45.280><c> see</c><00:55:45.559><c> what</c><00:55:45.799><c> systems</c><00:55:46.319><c> emerge</c> it go play and see what systems emerge it go play and see what systems emerge from<00:55:47.079><c> that</c><00:55:47.880><c> and</c><00:55:48.039><c> then</c><00:55:48.480><c> you</c><00:55:48.599><c> can</c><00:55:48.920><c> have</c><00:55:49.400><c> you</c><00:55:49.480><c> know</c> from that and then you can have you know from that and then you can have you know a<00:55:49.799><c> given</c><00:55:50.119><c> intelligence</c><00:55:50.640><c> system</c><00:55:51.079><c> based</c><00:55:51.359><c> on</c> a given intelligence system based on a given intelligence

system</c><00:55:55.359><c> in</c> know environment you put this system in know environment you put this system in and<00:55:55.839><c> all</c><00:55:56.039><c> the</c><00:55:56.200><c> kind</c><00:55:56.319><c> of</c><00:55:56.520><c> interactions</c> and all the kind of interactions and all the kind of interactions according<00:55:57.680><c> to</c><00:55:57.880><c> it</c><00:55:58.799><c> um</c><00:55:59.760><c> and</c><00:56:00.640><c> so</c><00:56:00.880><c> that's</c><00:56:01.119><c> kind</c><00:56:01.280><c> of</c> according to it um and so that's kind of according to it um and so that's kind of like<00:56:02.720><c> your</c><00:56:03.039><c> body</c><00:56:03.359><c> processes</c><00:56:03.960><c> much</c><00:56:04.119><c> higher</c> like your body processes much higher like your body processes much higher information<00:56:05.079><c> and</c><00:56:05.319><c> has</c><00:56:05.440><c> a</c><00:56:05.640><c> much</c><00:56:05.880><c> better</c><00:56:06.240><c> like</c> information and has a much better like information and has a much better like memory<00:56:07.960><c> um</c><00:56:08.960><c> because</c><00:56:09.319><c> I</c><00:56:09.480><c> I</c><00:56:09.599><c> I</c><00:56:09.720><c> think</c><00:56:10.000><c> it's</c><00:56:10.559><c> this</c> memory um because I I I think it's this memory um because I I I think it's this this<00:56:10.880><c> very</c><00:56:11.119><c> unconscious</c><00:56:11.799><c> process</c><00:56:12.559><c> and</c><00:56:12.680><c> so</c> this very unconscious process and so this very unconscious process and so listening<00:56:13.280><c> to</c><00:56:13.400><c> your</c><00:56:13.559><c> body</c><00:56:13.760><c> and</c><00:56:14.200><c> understanding</c> listening to your body and

it</c><00:56:16.559><c> is</c><00:56:16.680><c> something</c> what it's telling you um it is something what it's telling you um it is something that<00:56:17.000><c> needs</c><00:56:17.200><c> train</c><00:56:17.559><c> though</c><00:56:17.760><c> I</c><00:56:17.880><c> I</c><00:56:17.960><c> will</c><00:56:18.119><c> say</c> that needs train though I I will say that needs train though I I will say that<00:56:18.599><c> so</c><00:56:19.280><c> it's</c><00:56:19.480><c> based</c><00:56:19.720><c> on</c><00:56:19.880><c> like</c><00:56:20.000><c> the</c> that so it's based on like the that so it's based on like the information<00:56:20.640><c> you've</c><00:56:20.839><c> taken</c><00:56:21.319><c> in</c><00:56:22.319><c> so</c><00:56:23.039><c> if</c><00:56:23.160><c> you've</c> information you've taken in so if you've information you've taken in so if you've got<00:56:23.440><c> a</c><00:56:23.599><c> hunch</c><00:56:24.000><c> on</c><00:56:24.280><c>

is</c><00:58:45.960><c> no</c><00:58:46.160><c> reason</c><00:58:46.480><c> there</c><00:58:46.640><c> is</c><00:58:46.799><c> no</c> going there is no reason there is no going there is no reason there is no anything<00:58:47.559><c> it's</c><00:58:47.680><c> all</c><00:58:48.280><c> absurd</c><00:58:48.720><c> and</c><00:58:48.960><c> nonsensical</c> anything it's all absurd and nonsensical anything it's all absurd and nonsensical so<00:58:49.880><c> I'm</c><00:58:50.000><c> just</c><00:58:50.079><c> going</c><00:58:50.200><c> to</c><00:58:50.280><c> say</c><00:58:50.440><c> that</c><00:58:50.599><c> is</c><00:58:50.799><c> this</c> so I'm just going to say that is this so I'm just going to say that is this and<00:58:51.119><c> then</c><00:58:51.280><c>

structure<00:59:04.400><c> I</c><00:59:04.480><c> think</c><00:59:04.640><c> that</c><00:59:04.760><c> made</c><00:59:05.240><c> sense</c><00:59:06.240><c> no</c><00:59:06.480><c> I</c><00:59:06.880><c> I</c> structure I think that made sense no I I structure I think that made sense no I I definitely<00:59:07.240><c> see</c><00:59:07.400><c> what</c><00:59:07.480><c> you're</c><00:59:07.599><c> saying</c><00:59:07.960><c> there</c> definitely see what you're saying there definitely see what you're saying there um<00:59:10.280><c> and</c><00:59:10.839><c> I</c><00:59:11.000><c> I</c><00:59:11.079><c> think</c><00:59:11.280><c> like</c><00:59:11.559><c> with</c><00:59:12.160><c> that</c><00:59:13.160><c> the</c><00:59:13.799><c> idea</c> um and I I think like with that the idea um and I I think like with that the idea that<00:59:14.440><c> everything</c><00:59:14.880><c> is</c><00:59:15.359><c> just</c><00:59:15.640><c> kind</c><00:59:15.760><c> of</c><00:59:15.920><c> absurd</c> that everything is just kind of absurd that everything is just kind of absurd and<00:59:16.359><c> meaningless</c><00:59:17.079><c> is</c><00:59:17.960><c> totally</c><00:59:18.319><c> true</c><00:59:19.119><c> um</c> and meaningless is totally true um and meaningless is totally true um nothing<00:59:19.599><c> has</c><00:59:19.720><c> meaning</c><00:59:19.960><c> in</c><00:59:20.079><c> and</c><00:59:20.240><c> of</c><00:59:20.359><c> itself</c><00:59:21.280><c> it</c> nothing has meaning in and of itself it nothing has meaning in and of itself it has<00:59:21.680><c> meaning</c><00:59:22.000><c> that</c><00:59:22.160><c> we</c><00:59:22.319><c> give</c><00:59:22.440><c> it</c><00:59:22.880><c> and</c><00:59:23.079><c> so</c><00:59:24.079><c> um</c> has meaning that we give it and so um has meaning that we give it and so um one<00:59:25.280><c> of</c><00:59:25.400><c> the</c><00:59:25.559><c> things</c><00:59:25.799><c> that</c><00:59:26.000><c> that</c><00:59:26.119><c> I</c><00:59:26.400><c> I</c><00:59:26.559><c> really</c> one of the things that that I I really one of the things that that I I really personally<00:59:27.280><c> found</c> personally found personally found was<00:59:29.359><c> understanding</c><00:59:30.039><c> the</c><00:59:30.480><c> like</c><00:59:30.760><c> the</c><00:59:31.039><c> the</c><00:59:31.760><c> value</c> was understanding the like the the value was understanding the like the the value that<00:59:32.240><c> I</c><00:59:32.359><c> put</c><00:59:32.520><c> on</c><00:59:32.799><c> things</c><00:59:33.240><c> like</c><00:59:33.480><c> from</c><00:59:33.680><c> that</c> that I put on things like from that that I put on things like

the</c><01:00:00.359><c> time</c> then when I actually like spent the time then when I actually like spent the time to<01:00:00.839><c> like</c><01:00:01.240><c> think</c><01:00:01.480><c> about</c><01:00:01.720><c> what</c><01:00:01.839><c> I</c><01:00:01.960><c> valued</c><01:00:02.359><c> and</c> to like think about what I valued and to like think about what I valued and wrote<01:00:02.760><c> him</c><01:00:02.960><c> down</c><01:00:03.960><c> suddenly</c><01:00:04.319><c> I</c><01:00:04.400><c> realized</c><01:00:04.839><c> like</c> wrote him down suddenly I realized

as</c><01:00:07.799><c> I</c> oh actually this isn't as aligned as I oh actually this isn't as aligned as I thought<01:00:08.240><c> and</c><01:00:08.359><c> I'm</c><01:00:08.480><c> spending</c><01:00:08.760><c> a</c><01:00:08.799><c> lot</c><01:00:08.920><c> of</c><01:00:09.079><c> time</c> thought and I'm spending a lot of time thought and I'm spending a lot of time like<01:00:09.599><c> fighting</c><01:00:10.000><c> against</c><01:00:10.200><c> the</c><01:00:10.359><c> system</c><01:00:10.880><c> that</c> like fighting against the system that like fighting against the system that isn't<01:00:11.960><c> letting</c><01:00:12.359><c> me</c><01:00:13.119><c> you</c><01:00:13.240><c> know</c><01:00:13.520><c> behave</c><01:00:13.799><c>

and</c><01:00:15.079><c> so</c><01:00:15.319><c> that's</c><01:00:15.520><c> making</c><01:00:15.839><c> me</c><01:00:16.359><c> less</c> way I want and so that's making me less way I want and so that's making me less valuable<01:00:18.079><c> um</c><01:00:19.079><c> ultimately</c><01:00:19.480><c> getting</c><01:00:19.680><c> fired</c> valuable um ultimately getting fired valuable um ultimately getting fired because<01:00:20.440><c> that</c><01:00:20.599><c> wasn't</c><01:00:20.839><c> in</c><01:00:20.960><c> the</c><01:00:21.119><c> system</c><01:00:21.520><c> that</c><01:00:21.640><c> I</c> because that wasn't in the system that I because that wasn't in the system that I really<01:00:21.960><c> wanted</c><01:00:22.240><c> to</c><01:00:22.359><c> be</c><01:00:22.520><c> in</c><01:00:22.760><c> and</c><01:00:22.839><c> so</c><01:00:23.000><c> I</c><01:00:23.119><c> was</c> really wanted to be in and so I was really wanted to be in and so I was doing<01:00:23.599><c> stuff</c><01:00:23.920><c> that</c><01:00:24.200><c> didn't</c> doing stuff that didn't doing stuff that didn't help<01:00:25.440><c> that</c><01:00:25.640><c> system</c><01:00:26.280><c> because</c><01:00:26.640><c> they</c><01:00:27.520><c> there</c><01:00:27.640><c> was</c> help that system because they there was help that system because they there was no<01:00:27.920><c> structure</c><01:00:28.240><c> for</c><01:00:28.400><c> it</c><01:00:28.480><c> to</c><01:00:28.640><c> go</c><01:00:28.760><c> into</c><01:00:29.119><c> and</c><01:00:29.280><c> so</c><01:00:29.839><c> I</c> no structure for it to go into and so I no structure for it to go into and so I tried<01:00:30.280><c> to</c><01:00:30.400><c> put</c><01:00:30.520><c> it</c><01:00:30.640><c> into</c><01:00:30.880><c> that</c><01:00:31.039><c> system</c><01:00:31.760><c> and</c> tried to put it into that system and tried to put it into that system and they<01:00:32.000><c> ignored</c><01:00:32.319><c> it</c><01:00:32.480><c> because</c><01:00:32.680><c> it</c><01:00:32.799><c> didn't</c><01:00:33.039><c> fit</c> they ignored it because it didn't fit they ignored it because it didn't fit with<01:00:33.319><c> the</c><01:00:33.440><c> ideas</c><01:00:33.760><c> that</c><01:00:33.880><c> everybody</c><01:00:34.240><c> had</c><01:00:35.119><c> and</c><01:00:35.319><c> so</c> with the ideas that everybody had and so with the ideas that everybody had and so that<01:00:36.200><c> was</c><01:00:36.359><c> leaking</c><01:00:36.720><c> out</c><01:00:36.960><c> into</c><01:00:37.160><c> a</c><01:00:37.559><c> different</c> that was leaking out into a different that was leaking out into a different system<01:00:38.319><c>
