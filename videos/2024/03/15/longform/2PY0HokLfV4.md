through Slide by slide kind of what's through Slide by slide kind of what's going<00:00:48.039><c> through</c><00:00:48.199><c> my</c><00:00:48.440><c> head</c> going through my head going through my

to</c><00:00:52.600><c> really</c> so in the first slide I wanted to really so in the first slide I wanted to really capture<00:00:54.039><c> the</c><00:00:54.199><c> mission</c><00:00:54.559><c> that</c><00:00:54.680><c> I'm</c><00:00:54.840><c> working</c> capture the mission that I'm working capture the mission that I'm working toward<00:00:55.640><c> and</c><00:00:55.760><c> that</c><00:00:55.879><c> is</c><00:00:56.039><c> all</c><00:00:56.239><c> about</c><00:00:56.559><c> building</c> toward and that is all about building toward and that is all about building human<00:00:57.399><c> Centric</c><00:00:58.359><c> data</c><00:00:58.719><c> informed</c><00:00:59.239><c> systems</c> human Centric data informed systems human Centric data informed systems I<00:01:00.640><c> believe</c><00:01:01.120><c> we've</c><00:01:01.480><c> completely</c><00:01:01.960><c> abstracted</c> I believe we've completely abstracted I believe we've completely abstracted humans<00:01:02.920><c> away</c><00:01:03.440><c> from</c><00:01:03.640><c> the</c><00:01:03.800><c> systems</c><00:01:04.159><c> that</c><00:01:04.320><c> we</c> humans away from the systems that we humans away from the systems that we create<00:01:05.640><c> and</c><00:01:06.000><c> we</c><00:01:06.159><c> need</c><00:01:06.320><c> to</c><00:01:06.560><c> start</c><00:01:06.920><c> putting</c><00:01:07.240><c> them</c> create and we need to start putting them create and we need to start putting them back<00:01:07.759><c> at</c><00:01:08.320><c> the</c><00:01:08.759><c> core</c><00:01:09.280><c> of</c><00:01:09.439><c> what</c><00:01:09.600><c> we're</c><00:01:10.000><c> doing</c> back at the core of what we're doing back at the core of what we're doing we're<00:01:11.200><c> focusing</c><00:01:11.600><c> too</c><00:01:11.799><c> much</c><00:01:11.920><c> on</c><00:01:12.119><c> these</c><00:01:12.280><c> systems</c> we're focusing too much on these systems we're focusing too much on these systems that<00:01:12.840><c> scale</c><00:01:13.840><c> instead</c><00:01:14.200><c> of</c><00:01:14.720><c> doing</c><00:01:15.400><c> what</c><00:01:15.799><c> Paul</c> that scale instead of doing what Paul that scale instead of doing what Paul grams<00:01:16.400><c> says</c><00:01:16.560><c> we</c><00:01:16.680><c> should</c><00:01:16.880><c> in</c><00:01:17.000><c> the</c><00:01:17.080><c> early</c><00:01:17.320><c> days</c> grams says we should in the early days grams says we should in the early days of<00:01:17.560><c> a</c><00:01:17.640><c> startup</c><00:01:18.000><c> and</c><00:01:18.119><c> do</c><00:01:18.320><c> things</c><00:01:18.520><c> that</c><00:01:18.680><c> don't</c> of a startup and do things that don't of a startup and do things that don't scale<00:01:19.960><c> and</c><00:01:20.079><c> the</c><00:01:20.200><c> things</c><00:01:20.400><c> that</c><00:01:20.520><c>

that</c><00:01:21.799><c> help</c><00:01:22.680><c> individuals</c> are the things that help individuals are the things that help individuals truly<00:01:24.240><c> become</c><00:01:24.920><c>

are</c><00:01:27.079><c> human</c><00:01:27.759><c> Centric</c><00:01:28.759><c> this</c> systems that are human Centric this systems that are human Centric this forces<00:01:29.400><c> us</c><00:01:29.560><c> to</c><00:01:29.960><c> focus</c><00:01:30.240><c> on</c><00:01:30.400><c> the</c><00:01:30.560><c> fact</c><00:01:30.759><c> that</c><00:01:30.920><c> we</c> forces us to focus on the fact that we forces us to focus on the fact that we are<00:01:31.200><c> designing</c><00:01:31.840><c> systems</c><00:01:32.479><c> for</c><00:01:32.920><c> people</c><00:01:33.520><c> first</c> are designing systems for people first are designing systems for people first and<00:01:34.479><c> foremost</c><00:01:35.479><c> and</c><00:01:35.640><c> using</c><00:01:36.000><c> data</c><00:01:36.320><c> to</c><00:01:36.520><c> inform</c> and foremost and using data to inform and foremost and using data to inform those<00:01:37.159><c> systems</c><00:01:37.960><c> and</c><00:01:38.079><c> I</c><00:01:38.159><c> feel</c><00:01:38.360><c> like</c><00:01:38.560><c> this</c> those systems and I feel like this those systems and I feel like this captures<00:01:39.600><c> that</c><00:01:40.600><c> um</c><00:01:41.320><c> very</c><00:01:41.560><c> very</c> captures that um very very captures that um very very well<00:01:43.960><c> so</c><00:01:44.759><c> here's</c><00:01:45.040><c> kind</c><00:01:45.119><c> of</c><00:01:45.240><c> the</c><00:01:45.360><c> introduction</c> well so here's kind of the introduction well so here's kind of the introduction to<00:01:46.479><c> the</c><00:01:46.640><c> architecture</c><00:01:47.600><c> so</c><00:01:47.759><c> it's</c><00:01:48.000><c> time</c><00:01:48.240><c> to</c> to the architecture so it's time to to the architecture so it's time to build<00:01:48.759><c> a</c><00:01:48.920><c> human</c><00:01:49.240><c> Centric</c><00:01:49.560><c> internet</c><00:01:50.000><c> so</c><00:01:50.240><c> again</c> build a human Centric internet so again build a human Centric internet so again human<00:01:51.040><c> Centric</c><00:01:52.040><c> around</c><00:01:52.320><c> a</c><00:01:52.479><c> new</c><00:01:52.759><c> open</c><00:01:53.000><c> source</c> human Centric around a new open source human Centric around a new open source architecture<00:01:54.000><c> called</c><00:01:54.320><c> the</c> architecture called the architecture called the Nexus<00:01:56.079><c> cool</c><00:01:56.560><c> so</c><00:01:56.719><c> I</c><00:01:56.880><c> take</c><00:01:57.079><c> kind</c><00:01:57.200><c> of</c><00:01:57.320><c> the</c><00:01:57.479><c> Grand</c> Nexus cool so I take kind of the Grand Nexus cool so I take kind of the Grand Vision<00:01:58.759><c> and</c><00:01:58.920><c> I</c><00:01:59.119><c> solidify</c><00:01:59.680><c> it</c><00:02:00.079><c> just</c><00:02:00.240><c> a</c><00:02:00.399><c> bit</c><00:02:00.719><c> and</c> Vision and I solidify it just a bit and Vision and I solidify it just a bit and so<00:02:01.159><c> now</c><00:02:01.960><c> okay</c><00:02:03.200><c> there's</c><00:02:04.200><c> something</c><00:02:04.719><c> new</c><00:02:05.000><c> about</c> so now okay there's something new about so now okay there's something new about this<00:02:05.479><c> a</c><00:02:05.640><c> new</c><00:02:05.920><c> architecture</c><00:02:06.719><c> so</c><00:02:07.000><c> this</c><00:02:07.119><c> is</c><00:02:07.360><c> kind</c> this a new architecture so this is kind this a new architecture so this is kind of<00:02:07.840><c> the</c><00:02:08.759><c> way</c><00:02:09.520><c> I'm</c><00:02:10.520><c> connecting</c><00:02:11.080><c> the</c><00:02:11.280><c> mission</c><00:02:12.319><c> to</c> of the way I'm connecting the mission to of the way I'm connecting the mission to what<00:02:13.480><c> I'm</c><00:02:13.760><c> actually</c><00:02:14.440><c> doing</c><00:02:15.440><c> and</c><00:02:16.120><c> how</c><00:02:16.440><c> that</c> what I'm actually doing and how that what I'm actually doing and how that will<00:02:17.200><c> start</c><00:02:17.640><c> affecting</c> will start affecting will start affecting changes<00:02:20.640><c> so</c><00:02:20.840><c> the</c><00:02:21.040><c> problem</c><00:02:21.599><c> we</c><00:02:21.720><c> are</c><00:02:21.879><c> limiting</c> changes so the problem we are limiting changes so the problem we are limiting human<00:02:22.760><c> potential</c><00:02:23.640><c> with</c><00:02:23.959><c> poorly</c><00:02:24.360><c> designed</c> human potential with poorly designed human potential with poorly designed systems<00:02:25.760><c> again</c><00:02:25.959><c> this</c><00:02:26.120><c> goes</c><00:02:26.319><c> back</c><00:02:26.440><c> to</c><00:02:26.560><c> the</c><00:02:26.680><c> idea</c> systems again this goes back to the idea systems again this goes back to the idea that<00:02:27.040><c> we</c><00:02:27.160><c> are</c><00:02:27.360><c> not</c><00:02:27.599><c> centering</c> that we are not centering that we are not centering humans<00:02:29.920><c> within</c><00:02:30.160><c> our</c><00:02:30.400><c> systems</c><00:02:31.400><c> and</c><00:02:31.920><c> instead</c><00:02:32.920><c> we</c> humans within our systems and instead we humans within our systems and instead we are<00:02:34.599><c> creating</c><00:02:35.400><c> these</c><00:02:36.000><c> very</c><00:02:36.319><c> poor</c> are creating these very poor are creating these very poor abstractions<00:02:37.879><c> of</c><00:02:38.120><c> humans</c><00:02:38.720><c> that</c><00:02:38.920><c> represent</c> abstractions of humans that represent abstractions of humans that represent people<00:02:39.599><c> in</c><00:02:39.760><c> our</c><00:02:39.959><c> systems</c><00:02:40.720><c> and</c><00:02:40.879><c> don't</c><00:02:41.120><c>

needs</c><00:05:38.759><c> to</c><00:05:38.919><c> happen</c> understanding of what needs to happen understanding of what needs to happen acceleration<00:05:39.759><c> wise</c><00:05:40.759><c> um</c><00:05:41.120><c> and</c><00:05:41.280><c> so</c><00:05:41.479><c> why</c><00:05:41.639><c> now</c><00:05:41.960><c> like</c> acceleration wise um and so why now like acceleration wise um and so why now like I<00:05:42.240><c> think</c><00:05:42.520><c> really</c><00:05:43.039><c> the</c><00:05:43.199><c> the</c><00:05:43.319><c> main</c><00:05:43.600><c> point</c><00:05:44.000><c> is</c><00:05:44.199><c> the</c> I think really the the main point is the I think really the the main point is the introdution<00:05:44.800><c> of</c><00:05:44.880><c> llms</c><00:05:45.479><c> that</c><00:05:45.680><c> enables</c><00:05:46.080><c> this</c> introdution of llms that enables this introdution of llms that enables this architecture<00:05:46.800><c> to</c><00:05:47.160><c> happen</c><00:05:47.840><c> um</c><00:05:48.360><c> very</c><00:05:48.560><c> very</c> architecture to happen um very very architecture to happen um very very simply<00:05:49.199><c> because</c><00:05:50.080><c> we</c><00:05:50.199><c> can</c><00:05:50.360><c> essentially</c><00:05:50.759><c> create</c> simply because we can essentially create simply because we can essentially create a<00:05:51.120><c> network</c><00:05:51.560><c> that</c><00:05:51.919><c> allows</c><00:05:52.919><c> people</c><00:05:53.240><c> to</c><00:05:53.440><c> operate</c> a network that allows people to operate a network that allows people to operate or<00:05:54.400><c> machines</c><00:05:55.240><c> and</c><00:05:55.360><c> so</c><00:05:55.639><c> this</c><00:05:55.720><c> is</c><00:05:55.880><c> used</c><00:05:56.240><c> with</c> or machines and so this is used with or machines and so this is used with like<00:05:56.600><c> simply</c><00:05:56.840><c> an</c><00:05:57.000><c> API</c><00:05:57.600><c> of</c><00:05:58.120><c> language</c><00:05:58.720><c> we</c><00:05:58.880><c> can</c> like simply an API of language we can like simply an API of language we can send send send actual actual actual like<00:06:03.440><c> textual</c><00:06:04.039><c> thoughts</c><00:06:04.960><c> and</c><00:06:05.319><c> take</c><00:06:05.600><c> action</c> like textual thoughts and take action like textual thoughts and take action based<00:06:06.120><c> on</c><00:06:06.319><c> that</c><00:06:06.599><c> and</c><00:06:06.759><c> llms</c><00:06:07.400><c> really</c><00:06:07.599><c> enable</c> based on that and llms really enable based on that and llms really enable that<00:06:08.160><c> to</c><00:06:08.319><c> happen</c><00:06:08.880><c> so</c><00:06:09.080><c> this</c><00:06:09.160><c> is</c><00:06:09.319><c> the</c><00:06:09.479><c> perfect</c> that to happen so this is the perfect that to happen so this is the perfect time<00:06:10.080><c> to</c><00:06:10.280><c> introduce</c><00:06:10.720><c> this</c><00:06:10.840><c> new</c><00:06:11.440><c> architecture</c> time to introduce this new architecture time to introduce this new architecture um<00:06:12.720><c> and</c><00:06:12.880><c> create</c><00:06:13.199><c> this</c><00:06:13.360><c> network</c><00:06:13.960><c> that</c><00:06:14.120><c> can</c><00:06:14.319><c> work</c> um and create this network that can work um and create this network that can work with<00:06:15.120><c> humans</c><00:06:15.599><c> or</c><00:06:16.120><c>

all</c><00:06:20.199><c> right</c><00:06:20.880><c> so</c><00:06:21.680><c> talked</c><00:06:21.919><c> about</c><00:06:22.080><c> the</c> right all right so talked about the right all right so talked about the problem<00:06:23.160><c> solution</c><00:06:23.759><c> is</c><00:06:23.880><c> a</c><00:06:24.000><c> new</c><00:06:24.160><c> open</c><00:06:24.400><c> source</c> problem solution is a new open source problem solution is a new open source architecture<00:06:25.160><c> of</c><00:06:25.240><c> the</c><00:06:25.360><c> internet</c><00:06:26.240><c> called</c><00:06:26.520><c> the</c> architecture of the internet called the architecture of the internet called the Nexus<00:06:27.520><c> again</c><00:06:27.759><c> kind</c><00:06:27.880><c> of</c><00:06:28.000><c> a</c><00:06:28.120><c> restatement</c><00:06:29.000><c> of</c> Nexus again kind of a restatement of Nexus again kind of a restatement of that<00:06:30.000><c> initial</c><00:06:30.280><c>

again</c><00:06:35.360><c> so</c><00:06:35.520><c> we</c><00:06:35.720><c> kind</c><00:06:35.840><c> of</c><00:06:36.240><c> like</c><00:06:37.240><c> give</c><00:06:37.440><c> a</c> um and again so we kind of like give a um and again so we kind of like give a little<00:06:37.680><c> more</c><00:06:37.840><c> detail</c><00:06:38.240><c> here</c><00:06:38.680><c> so</c><00:06:38.880><c> it</c><00:06:39.000><c> allows</c> little more detail here so it allows little more detail here so it allows people<00:06:39.599><c> to</c><00:06:39.759><c> connect</c><00:06:40.319><c> through</c><00:06:40.960><c> ideas</c><00:06:41.960><c> and</c><00:06:42.080><c> so</c><00:06:42.240><c> I</c> people to connect through ideas and so I people to connect through ideas and so I kind<00:06:42.479><c> of</c><00:06:42.599><c> played</c><00:06:42.840><c> off</c><00:06:42.960><c> with</c><00:06:43.080><c> the</c><00:06:43.160><c> idea</c><00:06:43.479><c> like</c> kind of played off with the idea like kind of played off with the idea like instead<00:06:43.840><c> of</c><00:06:44.000><c> having</c><00:06:44.440><c> people</c><00:06:45.440><c> uh</c><00:06:45.840><c> work</c><00:06:46.120><c> and</c> instead of having people uh work and instead of having people uh work and communicate<00:06:47.039><c> through</c><00:06:47.400><c> like</c><00:06:47.680><c> business</c> communicate through like business communicate through like business requirements<00:06:48.639><c> right</c><00:06:49.520><c> um</c><00:06:49.880><c> and</c><00:06:50.000><c> then</c><00:06:50.120><c> that</c><00:06:50.240><c> was</c> requirements right um and then that was requirements right um and then that was kind<00:06:50.440><c> of</c><00:06:50.520><c> a</c><00:06:50.639><c> joke</c><00:06:50.880><c> in</c><00:06:51.000><c> terms</c><00:06:51.240><c> of</c><00:06:51.919><c> like</c><00:06:52.919><c> you</c><00:06:53.039><c> know</c> kind of a joke

that's</c><00:07:20.960><c> how</c><00:07:21.080><c> we</c><00:07:21.599><c> communicate</c><00:07:22.599><c> and</c><00:07:22.759><c> for</c> that's that's how we communicate and for that's that's how we communicate and for some<00:07:23.039><c> people</c><00:07:23.199><c> it</c><00:07:23.319><c> works</c><00:07:23.919><c> some</c><00:07:24.080><c> people</c><00:07:24.400><c> doesn't</c> some

is</c> nice part of this architecture is nice part of this architecture is because<00:16:07.880><c> it's</c><00:16:08.079><c> a</c><00:16:08.240><c> shared</c><00:16:08.759><c>

this</c><00:21:20.520><c> Nexus</c> internet as a whole and so this Nexus internet as a whole and so this Nexus architecture<00:21:21.600><c> can</c><00:21:21.799><c> actually</c><00:21:22.120><c> replace</c><00:21:22.559><c> all</c><00:21:22.720><c> of</c> architecture can actually replace all of architecture can actually replace all of these<00:21:23.120><c> and</c><00:21:23.279><c>

into 2024 into 2025<00:25:47.919><c> um</c><00:25:48.919><c> but</c><00:25:49.159><c> that</c><00:25:49.320><c> that's</c><00:25:49.520><c> going</c><00:25:49.600><c> to</c><00:25:49.679><c> be</c><00:25:49.760><c> kind</c> 2025 um but that that's going to be kind 2025 um but that that's going to be kind of<00:25:49.960><c> the</c><00:25:50.080><c> bigger</c><00:25:50.559><c> scale</c><00:25:51.559><c> uh</c><00:25:51.880><c> thing</c><00:25:52.640><c> and</c><00:25:53.000><c> we</c><00:25:53.520><c> kind</c> of the bigger scale uh thing and we kind of the bigger scale uh thing and we kind of of of um<00:25:56.279><c> yeah</c><00:25:56.480><c> just</c><00:25:56.600><c> be</c><00:25:56.760><c> based</c><00:25:57.039><c> a</c><00:25:57.120><c> lot</c><00:25:57.279><c> on</c><00:25:57.360><c> the</c> um yeah just be based a lot on the um yeah just be based a lot on the learnings<00:25:57.799><c> from</c><00:25:58.000><c> kind</c><00:25:58.120><c> of</c><00:25:58.480><c> the</c><00:25:58.640><c> the</c><00:25:58.720><c> first</c><00:25:58.960><c> two</c> learnings from kind of the the first two learnings from kind of the the first two products<00:25:59.760><c> in</c><00:25:59.919><c> terms</c><00:26:00.399><c> of</c><00:26:00.880><c> scaling</c><00:26:01.360><c> this</c><00:26:01.480><c> out</c><00:26:01.640><c> to</c> products in terms of scaling this out to products in terms of scaling this out to be<00:26:02.039><c> something</c><00:26:03.080><c> um</c><00:26:04.080><c> very</c><00:26:04.320><c> very</c><00:26:05.200><c> uh</c><00:26:05.399><c> agency</c> be something um very very uh agency be something um very very uh agency focused<00:26:06.960><c> and</c><00:26:07.960><c> um</c><00:26:08.440><c> able</c><00:26:09.000><c> to</c><00:26:10.000><c> really</c><00:26:10.440><c> enhance</c> focused and um able to really enhance focused and um able to really enhance the<00:26:11.960><c>

work at the speed of thought co-founder work at the speed of thought so<00:26:20.960><c> um</c><00:26:21.200><c> this</c><00:26:21.320><c> is</c><00:26:21.440><c> kind</c><00:26:21.559><c> of</c><00:26:21.679><c> just</c><00:26:21.760><c> a</c><00:26:21.880><c> quick</c> so um this is kind of just a quick so um this is kind of just a quick outline<00:26:22.399><c> of</c><00:26:22.520><c> the</c><00:26:22.640><c> features</c><00:26:23.120><c> that</c><00:26:23.279><c> that</c><00:26:23.399><c> kind</c> outline of the features that that kind outline of the features that that kind of<00:26:23.679><c> exist</c><00:26:23.960><c> within</c><00:26:24.240><c> that</c><00:26:24.440><c> so</c><00:26:24.640><c> there's</c><00:26:24.840><c> this</c> of exist within that so there's this of exist within that so there's this automatic<00:26:25.480><c> task</c><00:26:25.919><c> identification</c><00:26:26.919><c> so</c><00:26:27.120><c> as</c><00:26:27.240><c> you</c> automatic task identification so as you automatic task identification so as you think<00:26:28.320><c> the</c><00:26:28.399><c> things</c><00:26:28.559><c> you</c><00:26:28.640><c> need</c><00:26:28.760><c> to</c><00:26:28.880><c> do</c><00:26:29.080><c> get</c> think the things you need to do get think the things you need to do get identified<00:26:30.480><c> um</c><00:26:30.840><c> this</c><00:26:30.960><c> is</c><00:26:31.120><c> actually</c><00:26:31.360><c> really</c> identified um this is actually really identified um this is actually really important<00:26:32.320><c> because</c><00:26:32.840><c> that</c><00:26:33.440><c> sets</c><00:26:33.760><c> up</c><00:26:34.080><c> the</c><00:26:34.799><c> uh</c> important because that sets up the uh important because that sets up the uh next<00:26:35.279><c> thing</c><00:26:35.440><c> which</c><00:26:35.559><c> is</c><00:26:35.679><c> the</c><00:26:35.799><c> task</c><00:26:36.000><c> Marketplace</c> next thing which is the task Marketplace next thing which is the task Marketplace so<00:26:37.399><c> by</c><00:26:37.559><c> being</c><00:26:37.799><c> able</c><00:26:37.960><c> to</c><00:26:38.120><c> identify</c><00:26:38.559><c> the</c><00:26:38.720><c> work</c> so by being able to identify the work so by being able to identify the work that<00:26:39.000><c> needs</c><00:26:39.200><c> to</c><00:26:39.320><c> be</c><00:26:39.440><c> done</c><00:26:40.159><c> and</c><00:26:40.320><c> putting</c><00:26:40.600><c> it</c> that needs to be done and putting it that needs to be done and putting it into<00:26:41.440><c> an</c><00:26:41.559><c> Open</c><00:26:41.799><c> Marketplace</c><00:26:42.679><c> you</c><00:26:42.799><c> can</c> into an Open Marketplace you can into an Open Marketplace you can actually<00:26:43.279><c> gain</c><00:26:43.440><c> an</c><00:26:43.880><c> understanding</c><00:26:44.120><c> of</c><00:26:44.440><c> the</c> actually gain an understanding of the actually gain an understanding of the value<00:26:45.120><c> of</c><00:26:45.360><c> work</c><00:26:45.559><c> that</c><00:26:45.679><c> needs</c><00:26:45.880><c> to</c><00:26:46.000><c> be</c><00:26:46.120><c> done</c><00:26:47.000><c> and</c> value of work that needs to be done and value of work that needs to be done and so<00:26:47.679><c> this</c><00:26:47.880><c> creates</c><00:26:48.200><c> a</c><00:26:48.320><c> very</c><00:26:48.520><c> powerful</c><00:26:48.880><c> data</c><00:26:49.120><c> fly</c> so this creates a very powerful data fly so this creates a very powerful data fly wheel<00:26:50.240><c> that</c><00:26:50.399><c> will</c><00:26:50.720><c> allow</c><00:26:51.039><c> me</c><00:26:51.279><c> to</c><00:26:51.799><c> build</c><00:26:52.080><c> up</c> wheel that will allow me to build up wheel that will allow me to build up this<00:26:52.640><c> powerful</c><00:26:53.080><c> Marketplace</c><00:26:54.080><c> mechanism</c><00:26:55.080><c> um</c> this powerful Marketplace mechanism um this powerful Marketplace mechanism um that<00:26:55.880><c> I</c><00:26:56.000><c> can</c><00:26:56.120><c> use</c><00:26:56.360><c> to</c><00:26:56.600><c> create</c><00:26:57.399><c> uh</c><00:26:57.559><c> or</c><00:26:57.840><c> to</c> that I can use to create uh or to that I can use to create uh or to collect<00:26:58.480><c> data</c><00:26:59.159><c> that</c><00:26:59.279><c> will</c><00:26:59.440><c> allow</c><00:26:59.720><c> me</c><00:26:59.880><c> to</c><00:27:00.159><c> build</c> collect data that will allow me to build collect data that will allow me to build very<00:27:00.679><c> very</c><00:27:00.880><c> powerful</c><00:27:01.360><c> agents</c><00:27:02.360><c> that</c><00:27:02.840><c> can</c> very very powerful agents that can very very powerful agents that can understand<00:27:04.080><c> the</c><00:27:04.279><c> cost</c><00:27:04.480><c> of</c><00:27:04.679><c> work</c><00:27:05.240><c> uh</c><00:27:05.360><c> that</c> understand the cost of work uh that understand the cost of work uh that needs<00:27:05.679><c> to</c><00:27:05.799><c> get</c><00:27:05.960><c> done</c><00:27:06.559><c> in</c><00:27:06.720><c> terms</c><00:27:07.039><c> of</c><00:27:07.240><c> the</c> needs to get done in terms of the needs to get done in terms of the overall<00:27:07.760><c> value</c><00:27:08.080><c> created</c><00:27:08.480><c> and</c><00:27:08.600><c> so</c><00:27:08.840><c> once</c><00:27:09.000><c> it</c> overall value created and so once it overall value created and so once it sees<00:27:09.640><c> how</c><00:27:09.840><c> much</c><00:27:10.159><c> the</c><00:27:11.039><c> task</c><00:27:11.360><c> it's</c><00:27:11.559><c> working</c><00:27:11.840><c> on</c> sees how much the task it's working on sees how much the task it's working on is<00:27:12.520><c> worth</c><00:27:13.000><c> to</c><00:27:13.320><c> whoever's</c><00:27:13.880><c> requesting</c><00:27:14.320><c> and</c><00:27:14.520><c> get</c> is worth to whoever's requesting and get is worth to whoever's requesting and get done<00:27:15.600><c> then</c><00:27:16.000><c> it</c><00:27:16.120><c> can</c><00:27:16.279><c> make</c><00:27:16.440><c> determinations</c><00:27:17.200><c> as</c> done then it can make determinations as done then it can make determinations as to<00:27:17.559><c> which</c><00:27:17.720><c> work</c><00:27:17.919><c> to</c><00:27:18.080><c> do</c><00:27:18.720><c> based</c><00:27:18.960><c> on</c><00:27:19.120><c> the</c><00:27:19.320><c> cost</c> to which work to do based on the cost to which work to do based on the cost and<00:27:19.840><c> so</c><00:27:20.000><c> it</c><00:27:20.120><c> can</c><00:27:20.240><c> make</c><00:27:20.399><c> kind</c><00:27:20.520><c> of</c><00:27:20.640><c> this</c><00:27:20.799><c> cost</c> and so it can make kind of this cost and so it can make kind of this cost benefit<00:27:21.640><c> analysis</c><00:27:22.640><c> uh</c><00:27:22.760><c> on</c><00:27:22.960><c> its</c><00:27:23.200><c> own</c><00:27:24.200><c> um</c><00:27:25.080><c> so</c><00:27:25.240><c> I</c> benefit analysis uh on its own um so I benefit analysis uh on its own um so I also<00:27:25.559><c> have</c><00:27:25.919><c> uh</c><00:27:26.120><c> Dynamic</c><00:27:26.480><c> tool</c><00:27:26.720><c> generation</c><00:27:27.440><c> and</c> also have uh Dynamic tool generation and also have uh Dynamic tool generation and so<00:27:27.799><c> basically</c><00:27:28.360><c> you</c><00:27:28.440><c> can</c><00:27:28.520><c> take</c><00:27:28.640><c> a</c><00:27:28.760><c> thought</c><00:27:29.039><c> and</c> so basically you can take a thought and so basically you can take a thought and send<00:27:29.399><c> it</c><00:27:29.640><c> anywhere</c><00:27:30.640><c> um</c><00:27:31.320><c> and</c><00:27:32.000><c> that</c><00:27:32.120><c> can</c><00:27:32.200><c> just</c> send it anywhere um and that can just send it anywhere um and that can just trigger<00:27:32.640><c> things</c><00:27:32.799><c> to</c><00:27:33.000><c> happen</c><00:27:33.679><c> this</c><00:27:33.840><c> is</c><00:27:34.000><c> a</c><00:27:34.279><c> very</c> trigger things to happen this is a very trigger things to happen this is a very very<00:27:35.120><c> powerful</c><00:27:35.559><c> feature</c><00:27:35.960><c> because</c><00:27:36.320><c>
