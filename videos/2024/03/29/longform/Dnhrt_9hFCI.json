clear</c><00:00:52.640><c> that</c><00:00:52.800><c> I</c><00:00:52.920><c> need</c><00:00:53.160><c> to</c><00:00:53.559><c> start</c> becoming clear that I need to start becoming clear that I need

be</c><00:00:57.480><c> more</c> functionality is just going to be more functionality is just going to be more expensive<00:00:58.640><c> uh</c><00:00:58.760><c> for</c><00:00:58.920><c> example</c><00:00:59.320><c> there's</c><00:00:59.440><c> a</c><00:00:59.600><c> chat</c> expensive uh for example there's a chat expensive uh for example there's a chat feature<00:01:00.680><c> which</c><00:01:00.800><c> is</c><00:01:01.000><c> very</c><00:01:01.160><c> much</c><00:01:01.440><c> like</c><00:01:01.760><c> chat</c><00:01:02.079><c> GPT</c> feature which is very much like chat GPT feature which is very much like chat GPT except<00:01:03.120><c> for</c><00:01:03.440><c> it</c><00:01:03.600><c> uses</c><00:01:04.320><c> the</c><00:01:04.479><c> thoughts</c><00:01:04.879><c> that</c> except for it uses the thoughts that except for it uses the thoughts that you've<00:01:05.239><c> already</c><00:01:05.680><c> recorded</c><00:01:06.680><c> as</c><00:01:07.000><c> additional</c> you've already recorded as additional you've already recorded as additional context<00:01:08.119><c> within</c><00:01:08.360><c> your</c><00:01:08.560><c> chat</c><00:01:08.880><c> and</c><00:01:09.000><c> I've</c><00:01:09.159><c> done</c><00:01:09.280><c> a</c> context within your chat and I've done a context within your chat and I've done a little<00:01:09.560><c> bit</c><00:01:09.720><c> of</c><00:01:09.960><c> tuning</c><00:01:10.960><c> um</c><00:01:11.320><c> for</c><00:01:11.600><c> those</c> little bit of tuning um for those little bit of tuning um for those conversations<00:01:12.439><c> to</c><00:01:12.600><c> make</c><00:01:12.799><c> them</c><00:01:13.159><c> really</c><00:01:13.439><c> really</c> conversations to make them really really conversations to make them really really effective<00:01:14.759><c> but</c><00:01:14.920><c> it</c><00:01:15.000><c> uses</c> effective but it uses effective but it uses gp4<00:01:17.320><c> obviously</c><00:01:18.080><c> giving</c><00:01:18.400><c> that</c><00:01:18.600><c> away</c><00:01:19.119><c> would</c><00:01:19.360><c> get</c> gp4 obviously giving that away would get gp4 obviously giving that away would get expensive<00:01:20.079><c> really</c><00:01:20.360><c> quick</c><00:01:21.240><c> and</c><00:01:21.720><c> uh</c><00:01:22.079><c> that's</c><00:01:22.280><c> not</c> expensive really quick and uh that's not expensive really quick and uh that's not something<00:01:22.720><c> I</c><00:01:22.799><c> can</c><00:01:22.960><c> afford</c><00:01:23.200><c>

a</c><00:04:00.840><c> bunch</c><00:04:01.000><c> of</c> and then using that in a bunch of and then using that in a bunch of different<00:04:01.400><c> ways</c><00:04:01.840><c> and</c><00:04:02.040><c> so</c><00:04:02.879><c> I</c><00:04:03.000><c> think</c><00:04:03.319><c> this</c> different ways and so I think this different ways and so I think this really<00:04:03.760><c> makes</c><00:04:04.040><c> sense</c><00:04:04.239><c> for</c><00:04:04.360><c> a</c><00:04:04.480><c> freemium</c><00:04:04.959><c> model</c> really makes sense for a freemium model really makes sense for a freemium model where<00:04:05.920><c> I'm</c><00:04:06.079><c> bringing</c><00:04:06.439><c> people</c><00:04:06.640><c> in</c><00:04:06.799><c> for</c><00:04:06.959><c>

a</c><00:05:29.840><c> good</c> this point um and so that's it's a good this point um and so that's it's a good time<00:05:30.080><c> to</c><00:05:30.160><c> start</c><00:05:30.560><c> charging</c><00:05:31.560><c> it's</c><00:05:31.759><c> more</c><00:05:31.960><c> than</c> time to start charging it's more than time to start charging it's more than just<00:05:32.280><c> basic</c><00:05:32.600><c> functionality</c><00:05:33.520><c> but</c><00:05:33.840><c> it</c><00:05:33.960><c> it's</c> just basic functionality but it it's just basic functionality but it it's
