things that drain energy from us<00:01:06.600><c> as</c> us as us as creators<00:01:08.720><c> but</c><00:01:09.600><c> some</c><00:01:10.080><c> of</c><00:01:10.960><c> the</c><00:01:11.280><c> research</c><00:01:11.759><c> I've</c> creators but some of the research I've creators but some of the research I've been<00:01:12.119><c> doing</c><00:01:12.479><c> in</c><00:01:12.759><c> how</c><00:01:13.040><c> our</c><00:01:13.240><c> brain</c><00:01:13.680><c> uses</c><00:01:14.439><c> energy</c> been doing in how our brain uses energy been doing in how our brain uses energy and<00:01:16.240><c> where</c><00:01:16.520><c> this</c><00:01:16.720><c> idea</c><00:01:17.040><c> of</c><00:01:17.240><c> creativity</c><00:01:17.880><c> comes</c> and where this idea of creativity comes and where this idea of creativity comes from<00:01:19.119><c> I've</c><00:01:19.280><c> ended</c><00:01:19.520><c> up</c><00:01:19.720><c> developing</c><00:01:20.119><c> a</c><00:01:20.320><c> theory</c> from I've ended up developing a theory from I've ended up developing a theory which<00:01:21.040><c> is</c><00:01:21.600><c> basically</c><00:01:22.600><c> that</c><00:01:22.880><c> the</c><00:01:23.520><c> brain</c><00:01:24.000><c> is</c> which is basically that the brain is which is basically that the brain is most<00:01:24.560><c> creative</c><00:01:25.520><c> when</c><00:01:25.960><c> it's</c><00:01:26.960><c> using</c><00:01:27.960><c> the</c><00:01:28.159><c> least</c> most creative when it's using the least most creative when it's using the least amount<00:01:28.640><c> of</c><00:01:28.840><c> energy</c><00:01:29.680><c> and</c><00:01:30.159><c> has</c><00:01:30.400><c> a</c><00:01:30.560><c> lot</c><00:01:30.680><c> of</c><00:01:30.840><c> energy</c> amount of energy and has a lot of energy amount of energy and has a lot of energy available<00:01:32.759><c> so</c><00:01:33.320><c> let's</c><00:01:33.600><c> take</c><00:01:33.759><c> a</c><00:01:33.960><c> look</c><00:01:34.280><c> at</c><00:01:34.600><c> where</c> available so let's take a look at where available so let's take a look at where you<00:01:35.320><c> are</c><00:01:35.680><c> and</c><00:01:35.840><c> what</c><00:01:35.960><c> you're</c><00:01:36.159><c> doing</c><00:01:36.759><c> where</c> you are and what you're doing where you are and what you're doing where ideas<00:01:37.479><c> typically</c><00:01:37.960><c> come</c><00:01:38.280><c> from</c><00:01:39.280><c> there's</c><00:01:39.759><c> two</c> ideas typically come from there's two ideas typically come from there's two places<00:01:40.560><c> that</c><00:01:40.680><c> I</c><00:01:40.799><c> can</c><00:01:40.960><c> think</c><00:01:41.159><c> of</c><00:01:41.600><c> that</c><00:01:41.920><c> I</c><00:01:42.040><c> get</c> places that I can think of that I get places that I can think of that I get ideas<00:01:42.640><c> all</c><00:01:42.759><c> the</c><00:01:42.960><c> time</c><00:01:43.520><c> and</c><00:01:43.920><c> I've</c><00:01:44.119><c> seen</c><00:01:44.399><c> it</c> ideas all the time and I've seen it ideas all the time and I've seen it talked<00:01:45.000><c> about</c><00:01:45.280><c> a</c><00:01:45.399><c> lot</c><00:01:45.680><c> so</c><00:01:46.040><c> I'm</c><00:01:46.200><c> going</c><00:01:46.399><c> to</c><00:01:46.640><c> say</c> talked about a lot so I'm going to say talked about a lot so I'm going to say that<00:01:47.079><c> most</c><00:01:47.360><c> people</c><00:01:48.079><c> probably</c><00:01:48.479><c> have</c><00:01:48.719><c> ideas</c> that most people probably have ideas that most people probably have ideas predominantly<00:01:50.200><c> in</c><00:01:50.360><c> two</c><00:01:50.759><c> places</c><00:01:51.759><c> one</c><00:01:52.439><c> when</c> predominantly in two places one when predominantly in two places one when you're<00:01:52.719><c> out</c><00:01:53.280><c> walking</c><00:01:54.280><c> just</c><00:01:54.600><c> taking</c><00:01:54.920><c> a</c> you're out walking just taking a you're out walking just taking a walk<00:01:56.799><c> it's</c><00:01:57.039><c> amazing</c><00:01:57.640><c> how</c><00:01:57.799><c> many</c><00:01:58.039><c> things</c><00:01:58.320><c> can</c> walk it's amazing how many things can walk it's amazing how many things can come<00:01:58.719><c> to</c><00:01:58.920><c> you</c><00:01:59.240><c> when</c><00:01:59.399><c> you're</c><00:01:59.640><c> just</c> come to you when you're just come to you when you're just just<00:02:01.399><c> out</c><00:02:01.799><c> moving</c><00:02:02.200><c> a</c><00:02:02.560><c> moving</c><00:02:02.880><c> around</c><00:02:03.799><c> not</c> just out moving a moving around not just out moving a moving around not doing<00:02:05.119><c> a</c><00:02:05.240><c> lot</c><00:02:05.360><c> of</c><00:02:05.520><c> heavy</c><00:02:05.840><c> exercise</c><00:02:06.600><c> but</c><00:02:06.840><c> just</c> doing a lot of heavy exercise but just doing a lot of heavy exercise but just walking<00:02:08.360><c> and</c><00:02:08.479><c> the</c><00:02:08.599><c> other</c><00:02:08.720><c> one</c><00:02:08.879><c> is</c><00:02:09.000><c> in</c><00:02:09.119><c> the</c> walking and the other one is in the walking and the other one is in the shower<00:02:10.959><c> and</c> shower and shower and so<00:02:13.480><c> I</c><00:02:13.599><c> think</c><00:02:13.840><c> this</c><00:02:14.040><c> comes</c><00:02:14.280><c> down</c><00:02:14.440><c> to</c><00:02:14.640><c> the</c><00:02:14.840><c> fact</c> so I think this comes down to the fact so I think this comes down to the fact that<00:02:16.879><c> in</c><00:02:17.280><c> either</c><00:02:17.480><c> of</c><00:02:17.640><c> those</c><00:02:17.840><c> instances</c> that in either of those instances that in either of those instances typically<00:02:19.840><c> you're</c><00:02:20.160><c> not</c><00:02:20.840><c> using</c><00:02:21.840><c> all</c><00:02:22.000><c> of</c><00:02:22.120><c> your</c> typically you're not using all of your typically you're not using all of your available<00:02:22.720><c> energy</c><00:02:23.720><c> right</c><00:02:24.720><c> you</c><00:02:24.959><c> don't</c><00:02:25.480><c> need</c><00:02:26.319><c> to</c> available energy right you don't need to available energy right you don't need to expend<00:02:27.239><c> a</c><00:02:27.400><c> ton</c><00:02:27.599><c> of</c><00:02:27.760><c> energy</c><00:02:28.200><c> walking</c><00:02:29.160><c> unless</c> expend a ton of energy walking unless expend a ton of energy walking unless you're<00:02:29.599><c> walking</c><00:02:30.200><c> like</c><00:02:30.640><c> super</c><00:02:31.080><c> super</c><00:02:31.400><c> long</c> you're walking like super super long you're walking like super super long distances<00:02:33.120><c> but</c><00:02:33.319><c> even</c><00:02:33.599><c> then</c><00:02:34.480><c> it's</c><00:02:34.760><c> not</c><00:02:35.040><c> a</c><00:02:35.319><c> fast</c> distances but even then it's not a fast distances but even then it's not a fast burn<00:02:35.920><c> of</c><00:02:36.120><c> energy</c><00:02:36.800><c> whereas</c><00:02:37.080><c> if</c><00:02:37.200><c> you're</c><00:02:37.360><c> running</c> burn of energy whereas if you're running burn of energy whereas if you're running your<00:02:38.319><c> brain</c><00:02:38.599><c> is</c><00:02:38.879><c> constantly</c><00:02:39.360><c> trying</c><00:02:39.640><c> to</c><00:02:39.879><c> pump</c> your brain is constantly trying to pump your brain is constantly trying to pump energy<00:02:40.800><c> in</c><00:02:41.560><c> because</c><00:02:41.840><c> you're</c><00:02:42.120><c> using</c><00:02:42.560><c> a</c><00:02:42.720><c> lot</c><00:02:42.920><c> of</c> energy in because you're using a lot of energy in because you're using a lot of it<00:02:44.159><c> and</c><00:02:44.319><c> so</c><00:02:44.680><c> my</c><00:02:44.840><c> theory</c><00:02:45.120><c> of</c><00:02:45.239><c>

I</c><00:05:57.800><c> think</c><00:05:58.720><c> this</c><00:05:58.880><c> is</c><00:05:59.000><c> a</c><00:05:59.199><c> really</c> of laziness and I think this is a really of laziness and I think

this</c><00:06:47.479><c> is</c> do this and this is do this and this is in<00:06:49.520><c> contrast</c><00:06:50.039><c> to</c><00:06:50.199><c> a</c><00:06:50.280><c> lot</c><00:06:50.400><c>

an</c><00:07:17.080><c> offensive</c> lazy that's that's an offensive lazy that's that's an offensive thing<00:07:19.720><c> but</c><00:07:19.919><c> is</c><00:07:20.039><c> it</c><00:07:20.720><c>
