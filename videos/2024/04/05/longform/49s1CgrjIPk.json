if</c><00:00:58.000><c> I</c><00:00:58.160><c> built</c><00:00:58.399><c> a</c><00:00:58.920><c> submind</c> hm what if I built a submind hm what if I built a submind [Music] [Music] [Music] and<00:01:02.800><c> so</c><00:01:03.039><c> I</c><00:01:03.360><c> did</c><00:01:04.360><c> or</c><00:01:04.559><c> I</c><00:01:04.680><c> should</c><00:01:04.879><c> say</c><00:01:05.280><c>

basically<00:01:33.040><c> I</c><00:01:33.200><c> wanted</c><00:01:33.520><c> to</c><00:01:33.720><c> take</c><00:01:33.880><c> a</c><00:01:34.119><c> problem</c> basically I wanted to take a problem basically I wanted to take a problem that<00:01:34.720><c> I</c><00:01:34.799><c> was</c> that I was that I was facing facing facing and<00:01:38.560><c> make</c><00:01:38.799><c> somebody</c><00:01:39.119><c> else</c><00:01:39.360><c> think</c><00:01:39.560><c> about</c><00:01:39.759><c> it</c> and make somebody else think about it and make somebody else think about it and<00:01:40.600><c> somebody</c><00:01:41.000><c> else</c><00:01:41.479><c> in</c><00:01:41.640><c> this</c><00:01:41.880><c> case</c><00:01:42.840><c> is</c><00:01:43.000><c> my</c> and somebody else in this case is my and somebody else in this case is my submind<00:01:44.880><c> and</c><00:01:45.640><c> the</c><00:01:45.880><c> problem</c><00:01:46.079><c> I</c><00:01:46.159><c> chose</c><00:01:46.479><c> is</c> submind and the problem I chose is submind and the problem I chose is actually actually actually monetization<00:01:48.719><c> so</c><00:01:49.640><c> one</c><00:01:49.799><c> of</c><00:01:49.920><c> the</c><00:01:50.000><c> things</c><00:01:50.240><c> I've</c> monetization so one of the things I've monetization so one of the things I've been<00:01:50.520><c> looking</c><00:01:50.840><c> at</c><00:01:51.360><c> is</c><00:01:52.320><c> finding</c><00:01:52.799><c> investors</c><00:01:53.880><c> and</c> been looking at is finding investors and been looking at is finding investors and getting<00:01:55.880><c> users</c><00:01:56.280><c> to</c><00:01:56.520><c> pay</c><00:01:57.039><c> things</c><00:01:57.320><c> like</c><00:01:57.520><c> that</c> getting users to pay things like that getting users to pay things like that right<00:01:57.920><c> a</c><00:01:58.039><c> couple</c><00:01:58.280><c> different</c><00:01:58.520><c> approaches</c> right a couple different approaches right a couple different approaches there there there and<00:02:01.039><c> so</c><00:02:01.320><c> I</c><00:02:01.479><c> thought</c><00:02:02.039><c> you</c><00:02:02.159><c> know</c><00:02:02.600><c> what</c><00:02:03.600><c> what</c> and so I thought you know what what and so I thought you know what what if<00:02:05.439><c> I</c><00:02:05.560><c> made</c><00:02:05.840><c> the</c><00:02:06.200><c> app</c><00:02:07.200><c> figure</c><00:02:07.520><c> out</c><00:02:07.680><c> how</c><00:02:07.759><c> to</c> if I made the app figure out how to if I made the app figure out how to monetize monetize monetize itself<00:02:09.879><c> and</c><00:02:10.000><c> so</c><00:02:10.160><c> I</c><00:02:10.280><c> put</c><00:02:10.879><c> in</c><00:02:11.879><c> a</c><00:02:12.000><c> bunch</c><00:02:12.200><c> of</c> itself and so I put in a bunch of itself and so I put in a bunch of information<00:02:13.040><c> into</c><00:02:13.520><c> this</c> information into this information into this document<00:02:15.959><c> and</c><00:02:16.360><c>
