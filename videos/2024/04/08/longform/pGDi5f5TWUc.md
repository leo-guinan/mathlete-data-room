questions so basically as it's trying to questions so basically as it's trying to think<00:02:44.360><c> about</c><00:02:44.720><c> the</c><00:02:45.360><c> problem</c><00:02:45.680><c> you've</c><00:02:45.920><c> put</c><00:02:46.080><c> in</c> think about the problem you've put in think about the problem you've put in front<00:02:46.400><c> of</c><00:02:46.680><c> it</c><00:02:47.680><c> it</c><00:02:48.360><c> thinks</c><00:02:48.800><c> about</c><00:02:49.360><c> what</c> front of it it thinks about what front of it it thinks about what

has</c><00:02:55.239><c> to</c> accomplish its goal and then it has to accomplish its goal and then it has to differentiate<00:02:56.080><c> between</c><00:02:56.440><c> whether</c><00:02:56.760><c> those</c> differentiate between whether those differentiate between whether those questions<00:02:57.400><c> are</c><00:02:57.599><c> for</c><00:02:57.879><c> the</c><00:02:58.040><c>

a</c><00:03:50.480><c> great</c><00:03:50.720><c> way</c> that somebody can answer is a great way that somebody can answer is a great way to<00:03:51.080><c> get</c><00:03:51.239><c> them</c><00:03:51.400><c> to</c><00:03:51.599><c> record</c><00:03:52.000><c> thoughts</c><00:03:52.360><c> because</c> to get them to record thoughts because to get them to record thoughts because it's<00:03:52.760><c> very</c><00:03:53.000><c> very</c><00:03:53.360><c> specific</c><00:03:54.360><c> in</c><00:03:54.560><c> terms</c><00:03:55.280><c> of</c><00:03:56.280><c> hey</c> it's very very specific in terms of hey it's very very specific in terms of hey what<00:03:56.840><c> do</c><00:03:56.920><c> you</c><00:03:57.079><c> think</c><00:03:57.280><c> about</c><00:03:57.760><c> this</c><00:03:58.000><c> very</c> what do you think about this very what do you think about this very specific<00:03:58.920><c> context</c><00:04:00.200><c> and</c><00:04:00.319><c> so</c><00:04:00.519><c> by</c><00:04:00.680><c> doing</c><00:04:01.040><c> that</c><00:04:01.280><c> I</c> specific context and so by doing that I specific context and so by doing that I can<00:04:01.640><c> actually</c><00:04:02.120><c> get</c><00:04:02.319><c> the</c><00:04:02.480><c> user</c><00:04:02.840><c> thinking</c><00:04:03.319><c> in</c><00:04:03.439><c> a</c> can actually get the user thinking in a can actually get the user thinking in a way<00:04:03.840><c> that</c><00:04:03.959><c> gets</c><00:04:04.159><c> them</c><00:04:04.360><c> recording</c><00:04:04.879><c> thoughts</c> way that gets them recording thoughts way that gets them recording thoughts and<00:04:05.480><c> then</c><00:04:05.640><c> I</c><00:04:05.760><c> can</c><00:04:05.920><c>

I</c><00:04:21.079><c> see</c><00:04:21.359><c> how</c><00:04:21.560><c> incredibly</c> the app and I see how incredibly the app and I see how incredibly valuable<00:04:22.919><c> it</c><00:04:23.080><c> is</c><00:04:23.759><c> and</c><00:04:24.040><c> how</c><00:04:24.199><c> useful</c><00:04:24.560><c> it</c><00:04:24.680><c> can</c><00:04:25.080><c> be</c> valuable it is and

this<00:04:32.120><c> stuff</c><00:04:32.400><c> works</c><00:04:33.120><c> and</c><00:04:34.320><c> um</c><00:04:35.320><c> you</c><00:04:35.440><c> know</c><00:04:35.720><c> how</c><00:04:35.960><c> the</c> this stuff works and um you know how the this stuff works and um you know how the different<00:04:36.400><c> Pieces</c><00:04:36.759><c> come</c><00:04:37.120><c> together</c><00:04:37.400><c> to</c><00:04:37.680><c> really</c> different Pieces come together to really different Pieces come together to really put<00:04:38.280><c> something</c><00:04:39.240><c> uh</c><00:04:39.360><c> useful</c><00:04:39.720><c> on</c><00:04:39.840><c> the</c><00:04:40.000><c> table</c> put something uh useful on the table put something uh useful on the table here<00:04:40.960><c>

I'm</c> to get users to 100 thoughts I think I'm to get users to 100 thoughts I think I'm not<00:05:48.319><c> there</c><00:05:48.520><c> yet</c><00:05:48.720><c> with</c><00:05:48.880><c>

the</c><00:05:58.960><c> first</c><00:05:59.240><c> week</c> thoughts within the first week thoughts within the first week because<00:06:00.800><c> that</c><00:06:00.880><c> means</c><00:06:01.120><c>

all</c><00:06:33.759><c> of</c><00:06:33.840><c> a</c> part could be better then all of a part could be better then all of a sudden<00:06:34.240><c> they</c><00:06:34.319><c> can</c><00:06:34.560><c> come</c><00:06:34.880><c> back</c><00:06:35.479><c> and</c><00:06:35.759><c> say</c><00:06:36.160><c> oh</c> sudden they can come back and say oh sudden they can come back and say oh well<00:06:37.759><c> here</c><00:06:38.199><c> like</c><00:06:38.479><c> try</c><00:06:38.759><c> adding</c><00:06:39.080><c> this</c><00:06:39.240><c> in</c><00:06:40.160><c> and</c><00:06:40.319><c> so</c> well here like try adding this in and so well here like try adding this in and so it<00:06:40.919><c> creates</c><00:06:41.280><c> a</c><00:06:41.479><c> very</c><00:06:41.759><c> good</c><00:06:42.080><c> back</c><00:06:42.240><c> and</c><00:06:42.680><c> forth</c><00:06:43.680><c> um</c> it creates a very good back and forth um it creates a very good back and forth um with<00:06:44.120><c> the</c><00:06:44.280><c> user</c><00:06:44.599><c> to</c><00:06:44.759><c> get</c><00:06:44.919><c> them</c><00:06:45.080><c> coming</c><00:06:45.400><c> back</c> with the user to get them coming back with the user to get them coming back and<00:06:45.759><c> hopefully</c><00:06:46.120><c> finding</c><00:06:46.479><c> the</c><00:06:46.599><c> true</c><00:06:46.840><c> benefit</c> and hopefully finding the true benefit and hopefully finding the true benefit of<00:06:47.319><c> the</c><00:06:47.599><c> app</c><00:06:48.599><c> uh</c><00:06:48.759><c> so</c><00:06:48.919><c> we'll</c><00:06:49.039><c> see</c><00:06:49.160><c> how</c><00:06:49.280><c> that</c><00:06:49.400><c> goes</c> of the app uh so we'll see how that goes of the app uh so we'll see how that goes I<00:06:49.840><c> I</c><00:06:49.919><c> honestly</c><00:06:50.240><c> don't</c><00:06:50.440><c> know</c><00:06:51.120><c> um</c><00:06:51.880><c> you</c><00:06:52.039><c> know</c> I I honestly don't know um you know I I honestly don't know um you know there<00:06:52.280><c> a</c><00:06:52.360><c> lot</c><00:06:52.479><c> of</c><00:06:52.599><c> experimentation</c><00:06:53.319><c> at</c><00:06:53.440><c> this</c> there a lot of experimentation at this there a lot of experimentation at this face<00:06:54.199><c> but</c><00:06:54.639><c> uh</c><00:06:55.479><c> again</c><00:06:56.160><c> anytime</c><00:06:56.520><c> I</c><00:06:56.639><c> talk</c><00:06:56.840><c> to</c> face but uh again anytime I talk to face but uh again anytime I talk to people<00:06:57.440><c> and</c><00:06:57.560><c> I</c><00:06:57.680><c> show</c><00:06:58.120><c> them</c><00:06:58.560><c> like</c><00:06:59.720><c> and</c><00:06:59.879><c> talk</c><00:07:00.039><c> to</c> people and I show them like and talk to people and I show them like and talk to them<00:07:00.479><c> about</c><00:07:00.800><c> like</c><00:07:01.000><c> what</c><00:07:01.199><c> the</c><00:07:01.360><c> app</c><00:07:01.599><c> can</c><00:07:01.840><c> do</c><00:07:02.800><c> they</c> them about like what the app can do they them about like what the app can do they get<00:07:03.240><c> excited</c><00:07:03.840><c> they</c><00:07:04.039><c> just</c><00:07:04.199><c> don't</c><00:07:04.400><c> know</c><00:07:04.599><c> how</c><00:07:04.720><c> to</c> get excited they just don't know how to get excited they just don't know how to use<00:07:05.080><c> it</c><00:07:05.280><c> and</c><00:07:05.400><c> so</c><00:07:05.720><c> really</c><00:07:06.199><c> figuring</c><00:07:06.639><c> out</c><00:07:06.840><c> ways</c> use it and so really figuring out ways use it and so really figuring out ways to<00:07:07.199><c> get</c><00:07:07.400><c> them</c><00:07:08.400><c> to</c><00:07:08.639><c> use</c><00:07:08.960><c> the</c><00:07:09.160><c> app</c><00:07:09.440><c> and</c><00:07:09.599><c> find</c><00:07:09.840><c> the</c> to get them to use the app and find the to get them to use the app and find the use<00:07:10.280><c> in</c><00:07:10.440><c> it</c><00:07:10.680><c> so</c><00:07:10.879><c> that</c><00:07:11.080><c> they</c><00:07:11.199><c> can</c><00:07:11.440><c> do</c><00:07:11.639><c> whatever</c> use in it so that they can do whatever use in it so that they can do whatever they<00:07:12.039><c> want</c><00:07:12.319><c> with</c><00:07:12.440><c> it</c><00:07:13.400><c> that's</c><00:07:13.599><c> going</c><00:07:13.720><c> to</c><00:07:13.840><c> be</c><00:07:14.000><c>
