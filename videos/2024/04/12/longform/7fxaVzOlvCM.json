when</c><00:35:40.040><c> I</c> that going to be worth it and so when I that going to be worth it and so when I actually<00:35:41.200><c> um</c><00:35:42.200><c> build</c><00:35:42.720><c> businesses</c><00:35:43.400><c> the</c><00:35:43.480><c> way</c><00:35:43.599><c> I</c> actually um build businesses the way I actually um build businesses the way I look<00:35:43.880><c>

as</c> look at it is I actually look at it as look at it is I actually look at it as like<00:35:45.720><c> systems</c><00:35:46.320><c> right</c><00:35:46.520><c> and</c><00:35:46.640><c> I</c><00:35:46.800><c> and</c><00:35:46.920><c> I</c><00:35:47.320><c> try</c><00:35:47.560><c> to</c> like systems right and I and I try to like systems right and I and I try to design<00:35:48.040><c> a</c><00:35:48.280><c> system</c><00:35:49.119><c> where</c><00:35:50.119><c> you</c><00:35:50.280><c> know</c><00:35:50.800><c> the</c> design a system where you know the

can</c><00:35:54.400><c> be</c> amount of stuff coming in uh can be amount of stuff coming in uh can be turned<00:35:54.839><c> into</c><00:35:55.400><c> something</c><00:35:55.760><c> more</c><00:35:56.000><c> valuable</c><00:35:56.520><c> and</c> turned into something more valuable and turned into something more valuable and so<00:35:56.839><c> I</c><00:35:57.000><c> I</c><00:35:57.079><c> do</c><00:35:57.240><c> try</c><00:35:57.400><c> to</c><00:35:58.119><c> uh</c><00:35:58.400><c> I</c><00:35:58.480><c> am</c><00:35:58.599><c> trying</c><00:35:58.839><c> to</c> so I I do try to uh I am trying to so I I do try to uh I am trying to examine<00:35:59.319><c> it</c><00:35:59.480><c> on</c><00:35:59.640><c> this</c><00:35:59.960><c> like</c><00:36:00.960><c> um</c><00:36:01.520><c> very</c><00:36:01.800><c> lowc</c> examine it on this like um very lowc examine it on this like um very lowc cost<00:36:02.520><c> level</c><00:36:02.880><c> and</c><00:36:03.079><c> so</c><00:36:03.520><c> as</c><00:36:03.680><c> I'm</c><00:36:03.960><c> playing</c><00:36:04.240><c> around</c> cost level and so as I'm playing around cost level and so as I'm playing around with<00:36:04.720><c> the</c><00:36:04.920><c> these</c><00:36:05.079><c> different</c><00:36:05.319><c> pricing</c> with the these different pricing

I</c><00:58:29.559><c> get</c><00:58:29.640><c> it</c><00:58:30.079><c> now</c><00:58:31.079><c> so</c><00:58:31.280><c> I</c><00:58:31.400><c> have</c><00:58:31.520><c> a</c> like whoa okay I get it now so I have a like whoa okay I get it now so I have a I<00:58:31.799><c> have</c><00:58:31.880><c> a</c><00:58:32.039><c> theory</c><00:58:32.359><c> on</c><00:58:32.559><c> that</c><00:58:32.880><c> actually</c><00:58:33.680><c> um</c><00:58:34.079><c> and</c> I have a theory on that actually um and I have a theory on that actually um and it<00:58:34.359><c> it</c><00:58:34.480><c> relates</c><00:58:34.799><c> to</c><00:58:35.079><c> like</c><00:58:35.280><c> human</c><00:58:35.680><c> creativity</c> it it relates to like human creativity it it relates to like human creativity so<00:58:37.480><c> basically</c><00:58:37.880><c> the</c><00:58:38.000><c> way</c><00:58:38.119><c> I</c><00:58:38.240><c> look</c><00:58:38.400><c> at</c><00:58:38.520><c> it</c><00:58:38.880><c> is</c><00:58:39.480><c> um</c> so basically the way I look at it is um so basically the way I look at it is um you<00:58:40.160><c> know</c><00:58:40.359><c> basically</c><00:58:40.720><c> humans</c><00:58:41.039><c> are</c><00:58:41.440><c> like</c><00:58:42.440><c> a</c><00:58:42.599><c> big</c> you know basically humans are like a big you know basically humans are like a big battery<00:58:43.240><c> right</c><00:58:43.400><c> like</c><00:58:43.520><c> so</c><00:58:43.680><c> you</c><00:58:43.799><c> have</c><00:58:44.039><c> some</c> battery right like so you have some battery right like so you have some level<00:58:44.480><c> of</c><00:58:44.680><c> energy</c><00:58:45.039><c> stored</c><00:58:45.440><c> up</c><00:58:46.359><c>

you</c><00:58:48.880><c> have</c><00:58:49.160><c> like</c><00:58:49.280><c> a</c><00:58:49.400><c> lot</c><00:58:49.520><c> of</c> you're like when you have like a lot of you're like when you have like a lot of energy<00:58:50.160><c> and</c><00:58:50.240><c> you</c><00:58:50.359><c> don't</c><00:58:50.640><c> actually</c><00:58:50.960><c> have</c><00:58:51.039><c> to</c> energy and you don't

to</c><00:59:22.760><c> creativity</c> actually a detriment to creativity actually a detriment to creativity because<00:59:23.760><c> like</c><00:59:23.960><c> the</c><00:59:24.039><c> more</c><00:59:24.200><c> you</c><00:59:24.319><c> run</c><00:59:24.520><c> that</c> because like the more you run that because like the more you run that battery<00:59:25.079><c> down</c><00:59:25.599><c> the</c><00:59:25.720><c> brain</c><00:59:26.119><c> just</c><00:59:26.280><c> doesn't</c><00:59:26.599><c> have</c> battery down the brain just doesn't have battery down the brain just doesn't have the<00:59:26.960><c> extra</c><00:59:27.960><c> energy</c><00:59:28.520><c> to</c><00:59:28.760><c> put</c><00:59:28.960><c> towards</c> the extra energy to put towards the extra energy to put towards creativity<00:59:30.599><c> and</c><00:59:30.839><c> so</c><00:59:31.440><c> if</c><00:59:31.520><c> you</c><00:59:31.599><c> want</c><00:59:31.720><c>

we</c><01:34:35.719><c> have</c><01:34:35.800><c> to</c><01:34:35.880><c> give</c><01:34:36.000><c> people</c><01:34:36.199><c> choices</c> I think we have to give people choices I think we have to give people choices but<01:34:37.080><c> when</c><01:34:37.280><c> people</c><01:34:37.520><c> see</c><01:34:38.040><c> what's</c><01:34:38.480><c> possible</c><01:34:39.480><c> um</c> but when people see what's possible um but when people see what's possible um they<01:34:40.520><c> they</c><01:34:40.639><c> only</c><01:34:40.920><c> accept</c><01:34:41.280><c> what's</c><01:34:41.480><c> out</c><01:34:41.679><c> there</c> they they only accept what's out there they they only accept what's out there because<01:34:42.159><c> it's</c><01:34:42.440><c> what's</c><01:34:42.639><c> out</c><01:34:42.960><c> there</c><01:34:43.960><c> um</c><01:34:44.600><c> I</c><01:34:44.760><c> I</c> because it's what's out there um I I because it's what's out there um I I think<01:34:44.960><c> we're</c><01:34:45.080><c> going</c><01:34:45.280><c> to</c><01:34:45.440><c> shift</c><01:34:45.840><c> from</c><01:34:46.600><c> that</c> think we're going to shift from that think we're going to shift from that into<01:34:48.080><c> being</c><01:34:48.440><c> very</c><01:34:48.800><c> like</c><01:34:49.199><c> demand</c><01:34:49.560><c> driven</c><01:34:49.960><c> like</c> into being very like demand driven like into being very like demand driven like what<01:34:50.239><c> do</c><01:34:50.400><c> people</c><01:34:50.639><c> want</c><01:34:51.000><c> because</c><01:34:51.320><c> AI</c><01:34:51.719><c> can</c> what do people want because AI can what do people want because AI can produce<01:34:52.440><c> that</c><01:34:52.760><c> on</c><01:34:53.119><c> demand</c><01:34:53.800><c> right</c><01:34:54.280><c> and</c><01:34:54.400><c> so</c><01:34:54.560><c> you</c> produce that on demand right and so you produce that on demand right and so you can<01:34:54.880><c> actually</c><01:34:55.199><c> think</c><01:34:55.400><c> about</c><01:34:55.639><c> things</c><01:34:55.840><c> a</c><01:34:55.960><c> lot</c> can actually think
