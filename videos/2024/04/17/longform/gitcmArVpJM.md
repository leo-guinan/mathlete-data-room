I</c><00:01:07.159><c> I</c><00:01:07.240><c> think</c><00:01:07.439><c> the</c><00:01:07.600><c> idea</c><00:01:08.000><c> of</c><00:01:08.159><c> tweeting</c><00:01:08.680><c> is</c> use it I I think the idea of tweeting is use it I I think the idea of tweeting is very<00:01:09.119><c> similar</c><00:01:09.520><c> to</c><00:01:09.759><c> just</c><00:01:10.040><c> the</c><00:01:10.200><c> idea</c><00:01:10.479><c> of</c> very similar to just the idea of very similar to just the idea of capturing<00:01:11.200><c> thoughts</c><00:01:12.119><c> as</c><00:01:12.240><c> long</c><00:01:12.439><c> as</c><00:01:12.600><c> you</c><00:01:13.240><c> get</c> capturing thoughts as long as you get capturing thoughts as long as you get rid<00:01:13.560><c> of</c><00:01:13.680><c> all</c><00:01:13.840><c> the</c><00:01:13.960><c> ideas</c><00:01:14.280><c> of</c><00:01:14.520><c> like</c><00:01:14.640><c> building</c><00:01:14.960><c> an</c> rid of all the ideas of like building an rid of all the ideas of like building an audience<00:01:15.439><c> and</c><00:01:15.560><c> things</c><00:01:15.799><c> like</c><00:01:16.040><c> that</c><00:01:16.840><c> so</c><00:01:17.159><c> that's</c> audience and things like that so that's audience and things like that so that's at<00:01:17.439><c> least</c><00:01:17.640><c> the</c><00:01:17.799><c> basic</c><00:01:18.520><c> interface</c><00:01:19.520><c> um</c><00:01:20.119><c> and</c><00:01:20.280><c> then</c> at least the basic interface um and then at least the basic interface um and then instead<00:01:20.799><c> of</c><00:01:20.920><c> other</c><00:01:21.119><c> users</c><00:01:21.799><c> uh</c><00:01:21.960><c> responding</c><00:01:22.479><c> to</c> instead of other users uh responding to instead of other users uh responding to your<00:01:22.920><c> tweets</c><00:01:23.320><c> or</c><00:01:23.600><c> thoughts</c><00:01:24.240><c> what</c><00:01:24.360><c> you</c><00:01:24.520><c> have</c><00:01:24.680><c> is</c> your tweets or thoughts what you have is your tweets or thoughts what you have is you<00:01:24.920><c> have</c><00:01:25.000><c> a</c><00:01:25.119><c> submind</c><00:01:25.680><c> and</c><00:01:25.759><c> so</c><00:01:25.960><c> this</c><00:01:26.079><c> is</c><00:01:26.240><c> like</c><00:01:26.360><c> a</c> you have a submind and so this is like a you have a submind and so this is like a personalized<00:01:27.640><c> AI</c><00:01:28.640><c> from</c><00:01:28.880><c> the</c><00:01:29.079><c> app</c><00:01:30.159><c> and</c><00:01:30.680><c> what</c><00:01:30.840><c> it</c> personalized AI from the app and what it personalized AI from the app and what it does<00:01:31.360><c> is</c><00:01:31.520><c> it</c><00:01:31.720><c> actually</c><00:01:32.000><c> learns</c><00:01:32.520><c> about</c><00:01:33.040><c> you</c><00:01:34.040><c> uh</c> does is it actually learns about you uh does is it actually learns about you uh so<00:01:34.360><c> that</c><00:01:34.520><c> it</c><00:01:34.680><c> can</c><00:01:35.240><c> behave</c><00:01:35.720><c> as</c><00:01:36.200><c> closely</c><00:01:37.200><c>

pretty fascinating<00:04:21.639><c> and</c><00:04:21.799><c> so</c><00:04:22.199><c> what</c><00:04:22.360><c> I've</c><00:04:22.520><c> started</c> fascinating and so what I've started fascinating and so what I've started doing<00:04:23.960><c> is</c><00:04:24.479><c> basically</c><00:04:25.479><c> I</c><00:04:25.720><c> look</c><00:04:26.080><c> at</c><00:04:26.360><c> whether</c> doing is basically I look at whether doing is basically I look at whether it's<00:04:26.840><c> either</c><00:04:27.080><c> like</c><00:04:27.199><c> a</c><00:04:27.320><c> short-term</c><00:04:27.800><c> task</c><00:04:28.040><c> or</c><00:04:28.160><c> a</c> it's either like a short-term task or a it's either like a short-term task or a long-term<00:04:28.800><c> task</c><00:04:29.160><c> and</c><00:04:29.320><c> and</c><00:04:29.440><c> short</c><00:04:29.800><c> term</c><00:04:30.000><c> in</c> long-term task and and short term in long-term task and and short term in this<00:04:30.240><c> case</c><00:04:30.440><c> meaning</c><00:04:30.759><c> something</c><00:04:31.039><c> that</c><00:04:31.199><c> can</c><00:04:31.520><c> be</c> this case meaning something that can be this case meaning something that can be completed<00:04:33.160><c> um</c><00:04:33.600><c> in</c><00:04:33.840><c> like</c><00:04:33.960><c> a</c> completed um in like a completed um in like a single<00:04:36.039><c> uh</c><00:04:37.039><c> motion</c><00:04:37.600><c> right</c><00:04:37.759><c> or</c><00:04:37.960><c> a</c><00:04:38.120><c> single</c><00:04:38.840><c> task</c> single uh motion right or a single task single uh motion right or a single task um<00:04:41.520><c> and</c><00:04:42.520><c> right</c><00:04:42.680><c> now</c><00:04:42.960><c> if</c><00:04:43.080><c> it</c><00:04:43.199><c> thinks</c><00:04:43.400><c> it's</c><00:04:43.560><c> a</c> um and right now if it thinks it's a um and right now if it thinks it's a single<00:04:44.080><c> like</c><00:04:44.199><c> a</c><00:04:44.280><c> simple</c><00:04:44.600><c> task</c><00:04:44.840><c> like</c><00:04:45.000><c> that</c><00:04:45.199><c> that</c> single like a simple task like that that single like a simple task like that that can<00:04:45.440><c> just</c><00:04:45.520><c> be</c><00:04:45.720><c> completed</c><00:04:46.039><c> in</c><00:04:46.120><c> kind</c><00:04:46.240><c> of</c><00:04:46.320><c> one</c> can just be completed in kind of one can just be completed in kind of one step<00:04:47.520><c> um</c><00:04:47.840><c> it</c><00:04:47.960><c> says</c><00:04:48.280><c> Hey</c><00:04:48.479><c> I've</c><00:04:48.639><c> noted</c><00:04:49.000><c> that</c> step um it says Hey I've noted that step um it says Hey I've noted that great<00:04:49.960><c> keeping</c><00:04:50.240><c> track</c><00:04:50.479><c> of</c><00:04:50.720><c> that</c><00:04:51.720><c> um</c><00:04:52.240><c> but</c> great keeping track of that um but great keeping track of that um but doesn't<00:04:52.680><c> actually</c><00:04:52.880><c> do</c><00:04:53.080><c> anything</c><00:04:53.360><c> yet</c><00:04:53.520><c> because</c> doesn't actually do anything yet because doesn't actually do anything yet because I<00:04:53.800><c> haven't</c><00:04:54.000><c> built</c><00:04:54.240><c> any</c><00:04:54.400><c> of</c><00:04:54.479><c> the</c><00:04:54.560><c> tools</c><00:04:54.840><c> that</c> I haven't built any of the tools that I haven't built any of the tools that allow<00:04:55.199><c> it</c><00:04:55.440><c> to</c><00:04:56.440><c> uh</c><00:04:56.639><c> take</c><00:04:56.919><c> various</c><00:04:57.320><c> actions</c> allow it to uh take various actions allow it to uh take various actions that's<00:04:57.919><c> going</c><00:04:58.000><c> to</c><00:04:58.120><c> come</c><00:04:58.280><c> later</c><00:04:58.680><c> as</c><00:04:58.800><c> I</c><00:04:59.000><c> start</c> that's going to come later as I start that's going to come later as I start figuring<00:05:00.199><c> out</c><00:05:00.400><c> what</c><00:05:00.639><c> people</c><00:05:01.000><c> want</c><00:05:01.240><c> to</c><00:05:01.400><c> do</c><00:05:01.639><c> so</c> figuring out what people want to do so figuring out what people want to do so it's<00:05:01.919><c> got</c><00:05:02.039><c> to</c><00:05:02.080><c> be</c><00:05:02.160><c> a</c><00:05:02.240><c> lot</c><00:05:02.320><c> of</c><00:05:02.440><c> on</c><00:05:02.639><c> demand</c> it's got to be a lot of on demand it's got to be a lot of on demand building<00:05:04.400><c> um</c><00:05:05.400><c> and</c><00:05:05.560><c> then</c><00:05:06.080><c> there's</c><00:05:06.600><c> the</c><00:05:06.919><c> longer</c> building um and then there's the longer building um and then there's the longer tasks<00:05:07.960><c> and</c><00:05:08.080><c> so</c><00:05:08.240><c> what</c><00:05:08.320><c> I</c><00:05:08.400><c> said</c><00:05:08.560><c> is</c><00:05:08.680><c> if</c><00:05:08.800><c> there's</c><00:05:08.919><c> a</c> tasks and so what I said is if there's a tasks and so what I said is if there's a long-term<00:05:09.600><c> task</c><00:05:10.520><c> the</c><00:05:10.639><c> first</c><00:05:10.840><c> thing</c><00:05:11.000><c> that</c><00:05:11.120><c> I</c> long-term task the first thing that I long-term task the first thing that I can<00:05:11.479><c> do</c><00:05:11.800><c> because</c><00:05:12.039><c> it's</c><00:05:12.240><c> based</c><00:05:12.520><c> off</c><00:05:12.680><c> of</c><00:05:12.800><c> kind</c><00:05:12.919><c> of</c> can do because it's based off of kind of can do because it's based off of kind of the<00:05:13.080><c> earlier</c><00:05:13.440><c> version</c><00:05:14.320><c> is</c><00:05:14.520><c> create</c><00:05:14.759><c> an</c><00:05:14.960><c> action</c> the earlier version is create an action the earlier version is create an action plan<00:05:16.160><c> and</c><00:05:16.280><c> so</c><00:05:16.520><c> what</c><00:05:16.680><c> this</c><00:05:16.840><c> does</c><00:05:17.120><c> is</c><00:05:17.240><c> it</c><00:05:17.400><c> breaks</c> plan and so what this does is it breaks plan and so what this does is it breaks down<00:05:18.160><c> the</c><00:05:18.280><c> thing</c><00:05:18.479><c> into</c><00:05:18.759><c> steps</c><00:05:19.160><c> and</c><00:05:19.280><c> so</c><00:05:19.639><c> I</c><00:05:19.759><c> was</c> down the thing into steps and so I was down the thing into steps and so I was joking<00:05:20.880><c> around</c><00:05:21.360><c> about</c><00:05:21.919><c> uh</c><00:05:22.039><c> building</c><00:05:22.360><c> out</c> joking around about uh building out joking around about uh building out antisocial<00:05:23.240><c> media.</c><00:05:23.759><c> network</c><00:05:24.600><c> uh</c><00:05:25.039><c> which</c><00:05:25.199><c> I</c> antisocial media. network uh which I antisocial media. network uh which I actually<00:05:25.520><c> bought</c><00:05:25.720><c> the</c><00:05:25.840><c> domain</c><00:05:26.120><c> for</c><00:05:26.440><c> because</c><00:05:26.680><c> I</c> actually bought the domain for because I actually bought the domain for because I do<00:05:26.919><c> have</c><00:05:27.000><c> a</c><00:05:27.120><c> plan</c><00:05:27.440><c> there</c><00:05:28.400><c> um</c><00:05:29.400><c> it</c><00:05:29.720><c> you</c><00:05:29.840><c> might</c><00:05:29.960><c> be</c> do have a plan there um it you might be do have a plan there um it you might be able<00:05:30.199><c> to</c><00:05:30.560><c> figure</c><00:05:30.840><c> it</c><00:05:30.960><c> out</c><00:05:31.240><c> from</c><00:05:31.560><c> the</c><00:05:31.960><c> uh</c><00:05:32.720><c> from</c> able to figure it out from the uh from able to figure it out from the uh from this<00:05:33.039><c> video</c><00:05:33.400><c> based</c><00:05:33.639><c> on</c><00:05:33.800><c> what</c><00:05:33.919><c> I've</c><00:05:34.080><c> talked</c> this video based on what I've talked this video based on what I've talked about<00:05:34.680><c> but</c><00:05:34.800><c> we'll</c><00:05:34.960><c> see</c><00:05:35.919><c> um</c><00:05:36.319><c> and</c><00:05:36.479><c> so</c><00:05:36.840><c> I</c><00:05:36.960><c> asked</c><00:05:37.199><c> it</c> about but we'll see um and so I asked it about but we'll see um and so I asked it to<00:05:37.800><c> like</c><00:05:38.039><c> design</c><00:05:38.360><c> a</c><00:05:38.479><c> landing</c><00:05:38.840><c> page</c><00:05:39.080><c> and</c><00:05:39.199><c> so</c> to like design a landing page and so to like design a landing page and so what<00:05:39.440><c> it</c><00:05:39.560><c> did</c><00:05:39.720><c> is</c><00:05:39.840><c> it</c><00:05:40.120><c> actually</c><00:05:40.639><c> like</c><00:05:41.199><c> broke</c> what it did is it actually like broke what it did is it actually like broke that<00:05:41.639><c> down</c><00:05:41.800><c> into</c><00:05:42.039><c> a</c><00:05:42.120><c> bunch</c><00:05:42.319><c> of</c><00:05:42.479><c> steps</c><00:05:43.240><c> um</c><00:05:43.680><c> and</c> that down into a bunch of steps um and that down into a bunch of steps um and it's<00:05:44.000><c> also</c><00:05:44.600><c> like</c><00:05:44.800><c> taking</c><00:05:45.240><c> this</c><00:05:45.680><c> plan</c><00:05:46.680><c> and</c> it's also like taking this plan and it's also like taking this plan and creating<00:05:47.560><c> tasks</c><00:05:47.960><c> for</c><00:05:48.199><c> it</c><00:05:49.120><c> and</c><00:05:49.400><c> what</c><00:05:49.520><c> I'm</c><00:05:49.639><c> going</c> creating tasks for it and what I'm going creating tasks for it and what I'm going to<00:05:49.840><c> have</c><00:05:49.960><c> it</c><00:05:50.080><c> do</c><00:05:50.280><c> is</c><00:05:50.400><c> I'm</c><00:05:50.560><c> actually</c><00:05:50.720><c> going</c><00:05:50.800><c> to</c> to have it do is I'm actually going to to have it do is I'm actually going to give<00:05:51.000><c> it</c><00:05:51.160><c> the</c><00:05:51.280><c> ability</c><00:05:52.039><c> to</c><00:05:53.039><c> um</c><00:05:54.000><c> set</c><00:05:54.319><c> metric</c><00:05:54.759><c> so</c> give it the ability to um set metric so give it the ability to um set metric so like<00:05:55.080><c> it</c><00:05:55.199><c> can</c><00:05:55.360><c> do</c><00:05:55.639><c> something</c><00:05:56.440><c> and</c><00:05:56.560><c> then</c><00:05:56.720><c> say</c> like it can do something and then say like it can do something and then say this<00:05:57.080><c> is</c><00:05:57.160><c> a</c><00:05:57.319><c> metric</c><00:05:57.600><c> for</c><00:05:57.880><c> success</c><00:05:58.319><c> and</c><00:05:58.400><c> so</c><00:05:58.520><c> if</c> this is a metric for success and so if this is a metric for success and so if we<00:05:58.759><c> look</c><00:05:58.919><c> down</c><00:05:59.160><c> here</c><00:05:59.319><c> I</c><00:05:59.440><c> actually</c><00:05:59.880><c> have</c><00:06:00.039><c> it</c><00:06:00.840><c> uh</c> we look down here I actually have it uh we look down here I actually have it uh so<00:06:02.080><c> it's</c><00:06:02.280><c> it's</c><00:06:02.560><c> tracking</c><00:06:03.000><c> these</c><00:06:03.240><c> metrics</c> so it's it's tracking these metrics so it's it's tracking these metrics right<00:06:04.759><c> and</c><00:06:05.199><c> what</c><00:06:05.319><c> it's</c><00:06:05.479><c> going</c><00:06:05.639><c> to</c><00:06:05.800><c> eventually</c> right and what it's going to eventually right and what it's going to eventually have<00:06:06.280><c> the</c><00:06:06.400><c> ability</c><00:06:06.720><c> to</c><00:06:06.919><c> do</c><00:06:07.840><c> is</c><00:06:08.400><c> say</c><00:06:09.039><c> hey</c><00:06:09.520><c> this</c> have the ability to do is say hey this have the ability to do is say hey this is<00:06:09.759><c> the</c><00:06:09.919><c> metric</c><00:06:10.280><c> I</c><00:06:10.360><c> want</c><00:06:10.479><c> to</c><00:06:10.680><c> look</c><00:06:10.919><c> at</c><00:06:11.759><c> and</c><00:06:11.919><c> then</c> is the metric I want to look at and then is the metric I want to look at and then periodically<00:06:13.039><c> ask</c><00:06:13.280><c> the</c><00:06:13.479><c> user</c><00:06:13.919><c> for</c><00:06:14.280><c> those</c> periodically ask the user for those periodically ask the user for those metrics<00:06:15.759><c> and</c><00:06:15.960><c> so</c><00:06:16.280><c> what</c><00:06:16.479><c> that</c><00:06:16.639><c> does</c><00:06:16.919><c> is</c><00:06:17.080><c> it</c> metrics and so what that does is it metrics and so what that does is it creates<00:06:17.520><c> a</c><00:06:17.680><c> feedback</c><00:06:18.080><c> loop</c><00:06:18.520><c> where</c><00:06:18.759><c> it</c><00:06:18.880><c> can</c><00:06:19.039><c> get</c> creates a feedback loop where it can get creates a feedback loop where it can get metrics<00:06:19.639><c> from</c><00:06:19.840><c> systems</c><00:06:20.199><c> that</c><00:06:20.319><c> it</c><00:06:20.479><c> can't</c> metrics from systems that it can't metrics from systems that it can't actually<00:06:21.680><c> see</c><00:06:22.680><c> um</c><00:06:23.080><c> you</c><00:06:23.199><c> know</c><00:06:23.400><c> can</c><00:06:23.639><c>

it because it's still good way to do it because it's still going<00:06:43.160><c> to</c><00:06:43.280><c> save</c><00:06:43.440><c> you</c><00:06:43.560><c> a</c><00:06:43.680><c>

trying<00:06:45.919><c> to</c><00:06:46.160><c> figure</c><00:06:46.479><c> out</c><00:06:47.000><c> what's</c><00:06:47.240><c> important</c><00:06:47.560><c> to</c> trying to figure out what's important to trying to figure out what's important to actually<00:06:48.120><c> look</c><00:06:48.319><c> at</c><00:06:48.520><c> in</c><00:06:48.599><c> terms</c><00:06:48.840><c> of</c><00:06:49.440><c> metrics</c><00:06:50.440><c> um</c> actually look at in terms of metrics um actually look at in terms of metrics um and<00:06:51.440><c> so</c><00:06:51.639><c> that's</c><00:06:51.800><c> one</c><00:06:52.000><c> piece</c><00:06:52.199><c> of</c><00:06:52.360><c> it</c><00:06:53.240><c> the</c><00:06:53.720><c> uh</c> and so that's one piece of it the uh and so that's one piece of it the uh next<00:06:54.919><c> piece</c><00:06:55.120><c> that</c><00:06:55.240><c> I</c><00:06:55.319><c> think</c><00:06:55.440><c> is</c><00:06:55.560><c> cool</c><00:06:55.800><c> is</c> next piece that I think is cool is next piece that I think is cool is actually<00:06:56.360><c> the</c><00:06:56.560><c> idea</c><00:06:56.919><c> of</c><00:06:57.039><c> a</c><00:06:57.280><c> reflection</c><00:06:57.960><c> task</c> actually the idea of a reflection task actually the idea of a reflection task and<00:06:59.080><c> so</c><00:06:59.319><c> what</c><00:06:59.680><c> this</c><00:06:59.919><c> does</c><00:07:00.479><c> is</c><00:07:00.919><c> it</c><00:07:01.080><c> allows</c><00:07:01.479><c> the</c> and so what this does is it allows the and so what this does is it allows the AI<00:07:02.240><c> to</c><00:07:03.080><c> you</c><00:07:03.199><c> know</c><00:07:03.360><c> the</c><00:07:03.479><c> submind</c><00:07:04.080><c> to</c><00:07:04.240><c> be</c><00:07:04.360><c> able</c><00:07:04.520><c> to</c> AI to you know the submind to be able to AI to you know the submind to be able to tell<00:07:04.960><c> you</c><00:07:05.199><c> what</c><00:07:05.360><c> it</c><00:07:05.479><c> knows</c><00:07:05.840><c> about</c><00:07:06.280><c> you</c><00:07:07.280><c> um</c><00:07:07.919><c> and</c> tell you what it knows about you um and tell you what it knows about you um and so<00:07:08.599><c> I</c><00:07:08.680><c> think</c><00:07:08.879><c> this</c><00:07:09.000><c> is</c><00:07:09.199><c> important</c><00:07:09.599><c> because</c><00:07:09.800><c> I</c> so I think this is important because I so I think this is important because I want<00:07:10.120><c> the</c><00:07:10.240><c> user</c><00:07:10.520><c> to</c><00:07:10.759><c> have</c><00:07:11.520><c> the</c><00:07:11.680><c> ability</c><00:07:12.160><c> to</c> want the user to have the ability to want the user to have the ability to change<00:07:13.280><c> what</c><00:07:13.400><c> the</c><00:07:13.520><c> sub</c><00:07:13.759><c> mine</c><00:07:13.919><c> knows</c><00:07:14.160><c> about</c> change what the sub mine knows about change what the sub mine knows about them<00:07:14.479><c> it's</c><00:07:14.639><c> supposed</c><00:07:14.919><c> to</c><00:07:15.080><c> align</c><00:07:15.440><c> with</c><00:07:15.759><c> who</c> them it's supposed to align with who them it's supposed to align with who they<00:07:16.160><c> are</c><00:07:16.479><c> and</c><00:07:16.800><c> who</c><00:07:17.000><c> they</c><00:07:17.160><c> want</c><00:07:17.360><c> to</c><00:07:17.520><c> be</c><00:07:18.240><c> be</c><00:07:19.240><c> um</c> they are and who they want to be be um they are and who they want to be be um and<00:07:19.879><c> so</c><00:07:20.120><c> if</c><00:07:20.240><c> it</c><00:07:20.360><c> learns</c><00:07:20.720><c> something</c><00:07:21.240><c> wrong</c><00:07:22.240><c> um</c> and so if it learns something wrong um and so if it learns something wrong um this<00:07:22.919><c> mechanism</c><00:07:23.440><c> actually</c><00:07:23.800><c> will</c><00:07:24.000><c> just</c><00:07:24.160><c> give</c> this mechanism actually will just give this mechanism actually will just give it<00:07:24.440><c> the</c><00:07:24.599><c> ability</c><00:07:25.360><c> to</c><00:07:26.400><c> um</c><00:07:27.400><c> you</c><00:07:27.520><c> know</c><00:07:27.680><c> show</c><00:07:27.919><c> the</c> it the ability to um you know show the it the ability to um you know show the user<00:07:28.400><c> what</c><00:07:28.560><c> it</c><00:07:29.240><c> thinks</c><00:07:29.879><c> the</c><00:07:30.080><c>
