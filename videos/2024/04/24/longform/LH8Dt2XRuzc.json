something that was travel this is something that was interesting<00:02:57.760><c> I</c><00:02:57.840><c> believe</c><00:02:58.080><c> when</c><00:02:58.239><c> react</c><00:02:58.680><c> first</c> interesting I believe when react first interesting I believe when react first came<00:02:59.120><c> out</c><00:03:00.159><c> um</c><00:03:00.560><c> there</c><00:03:00.720><c> was</c><00:03:00.840><c> the</c><00:03:01.120><c> concept</c><00:03:02.000><c> of</c> came out um there was the concept of came out um there was the concept of time<00:03:03.120><c> travel</c><00:03:03.640><c> in</c><00:03:03.959><c> apps</c><00:03:04.400><c> where</c><00:03:04.560><c> you</c><00:03:04.680><c> could</c> time travel in apps where you could time travel in apps where you could basically<00:03:06.560><c> walk</c><00:03:07.040><c> back</c><00:03:07.440><c> from</c><00:03:08.080><c> a</c><00:03:08.239><c> certain</c><00:03:08.799><c> time</c> basically walk back from a certain time basically walk back from a certain time and<00:03:09.879><c> then</c><00:03:10.159><c> replay</c><00:03:10.760><c> that</c><00:03:10.920><c> entire</c><00:03:11.360><c> session</c><00:03:11.959><c> of</c> and then replay that entire session of and then replay that entire session of like<00:03:12.400><c> what</c><00:03:12.519><c> the</c><00:03:12.640><c> user</c><00:03:13.440><c> did</c><00:03:14.440><c> um</c><00:03:14.879><c> things</c><00:03:15.200><c> like</c> like what the user did um things like like what the user did um things like that that that and<00:03:18.239><c> that</c><00:03:18.360><c> is</c><00:03:18.480><c> a</c><00:03:18.640><c> powerful</c><00:03:19.000><c> mechanism</c><00:03:19.480><c> so</c><00:03:19.599><c> one</c> and that is a powerful mechanism so one and that is a powerful mechanism so one thing<00:03:19.879><c> you</c><00:03:19.959><c> want</c><00:03:20.040><c> to</c><00:03:20.159><c> do</c><00:03:20.360><c> when</c><00:03:20.440><c> you're</c><00:03:20.599><c> looking</c> thing you want to do when you're looking thing you want to do when you're looking to<00:03:21.239><c> you</c><00:03:21.360><c> know</c><00:03:21.920><c> time</c><00:03:22.200><c> travel</c><00:03:22.519><c> with</c><00:03:22.720><c> information</c> to you know time travel with information to you know time travel with information is<00:03:23.840><c> basically</c><00:03:24.560><c> you</c><00:03:24.720><c> need</c><00:03:25.000><c> to</c><00:03:25.239><c> say</c> is basically you need to say is basically you need to say okay<00:03:27.400><c> what</c><00:03:28.159><c> was</c><00:03:28.400><c> the</c><00:03:28.599><c> state</c><00:03:28.840><c> of</c><00:03:29.000><c> the</c><00:03:29.200><c> system</c> okay what was the state of the system okay what was the state of the system at<00:03:31.280><c> a</c><00:03:31.519><c> given</c><00:03:32.200><c> time</c><00:03:33.200><c> and</c><00:03:33.560><c> if</c><00:03:33.680><c> you</c><00:03:33.840><c> can</c><00:03:34.120><c> actually</c> at a given time and if you can actually at a given time and if you can actually figure<00:03:34.959><c> that</c><00:03:35.159><c> out</c><00:03:35.480><c> and</c><00:03:35.640><c> it</c><00:03:35.799><c> can</c><00:03:36.000><c> be</c><00:03:36.200><c> tough</c> figure that out and it can be tough figure that out and it can be tough because<00:03:37.040><c> a</c><00:03:37.120><c> lot</c><00:03:37.280><c> of</c><00:03:37.480><c> systems</c><00:03:38.480><c> you</c><00:03:38.599><c> know</c><00:03:39.040><c> mutate</c> because a lot of systems you know mutate because a lot of systems you know mutate evolve<00:03:40.159><c> over</c><00:03:40.439><c> time</c><00:03:40.640><c> so</c><00:03:40.879><c> any</c><00:03:41.760><c> long</c><00:03:42.040><c> stretch</c><00:03:42.360><c> of</c> evolve over time so any long stretch of evolve over time so any long stretch of time<00:03:42.720><c> it's</c><00:03:42.879><c> going</c><00:03:42.959><c> to</c><00:03:43.040><c> be</c><00:03:43.200><c> very</c><00:03:43.400><c> very</c><00:03:43.599><c> hard</c><00:03:43.760><c> to</c> time it's going to be very very hard to time it's going to be very very hard to recreate<00:03:44.439><c> the</c><00:03:44.720><c> exact</c><00:03:45.959><c> um</c><00:03:46.959><c> moment</c><00:03:47.280><c> in</c> recreate the exact um moment in recreate the exact um moment in time<00:03:49.080><c> but</c><00:03:50.040><c> I</c><00:03:50.200><c> actually</c><00:03:50.360><c> have</c><00:03:50.480><c> a</c><00:03:50.599><c> theory</c><00:03:50.879><c> that</c> time but I actually have a theory that time but I actually have a theory that you<00:03:51.120><c> don't</c><00:03:51.560><c> need</c><00:03:52.560><c> an</c><00:03:52.840><c> exact</c><00:03:53.519><c> copy</c><00:03:54.519><c> I</c><00:03:54.720><c> I</c><00:03:54.840><c> think</c> you don't need an exact copy I I think you don't need an exact copy I I think basically<00:03:56.319><c> with</c><00:03:56.439><c> a</c><00:03:56.560><c> lot</c><00:03:56.680><c> of</c><00:03:56.799><c> our</c><00:03:57.000><c> systems</c><00:03:57.519><c> it's</c> basically with a lot of our systems it's basically with a lot of our systems it's possible<00:03:58.239><c> to</c><00:03:59.200><c> uh</c><00:03:59.760><c> Pro</c><00:04:00.000><c> imate</c><00:04:00.959><c> uh</c><00:04:01.599><c> the</c><00:04:01.760><c> state</c><00:04:01.959><c> of</c> possible to uh Pro imate uh the state of possible to uh Pro imate uh the state of a<00:04:02.280><c> system</c><00:04:02.599><c> at</c><00:04:02.720><c> a</c><00:04:02.879><c> given</c><00:04:03.239><c> time</c><00:04:04.159><c> and</c><00:04:04.400><c> kind</c><00:04:04.560><c> of</c> a system at a given time and kind of a system at a given time and kind of reduce<00:04:05.239><c> it</c><00:04:05.480><c> down</c><00:04:05.959><c> to</c><00:04:06.959><c> its</c><00:04:07.200><c> component</c><00:04:07.680><c> pieces</c> reduce it down to its component pieces reduce it down to its component pieces and<00:04:08.239><c> so</c><00:04:08.519><c> if</c><00:04:08.640><c> you</c><00:04:08.840><c> think</c><00:04:09.599><c> of</c><00:04:10.599><c> you</c><00:04:10.760><c> know</c><00:04:11.439><c> a</c><00:04:11.560><c> few</c> and so if you think of you know a few and so if you think of you know a few key<00:04:13.360><c> parts</c><00:04:14.200><c> that</c><00:04:14.400><c> really</c><00:04:14.720><c> influence</c><00:04:15.319><c> the</c> key parts that really influence the key parts that really influence the system system system heavily<00:04:17.880><c> you</c><00:04:18.040><c> don't</c><00:04:18.359><c> actually</c><00:04:18.639><c> need</c><00:04:18.799><c> to</c><00:04:19.040><c> be</c> heavily you don't actually need to be heavily you don't actually need to be fully<00:04:20.040><c> exact</c><00:04:20.759><c> and</c><00:04:20.919><c> then</c><00:04:21.239><c> you</c><00:04:21.440><c> can</c><00:04:21.840><c> kind</c><00:04:21.959><c> of</c><00:04:22.079><c> say</c> fully exact and then you can kind of say fully exact and then you can kind of say okay<00:04:22.600><c> well</c><00:04:22.720><c> what</c><00:04:22.880><c> decisions</c><00:04:23.280><c> were</c> okay well what decisions were okay well what decisions were made<00:04:25.560><c> and</c><00:04:26.680><c> um</c><00:04:27.680><c> you</c><00:04:27.840><c> know</c><00:04:28.160><c> how</c><00:04:28.360><c> would</c><00:04:28.560><c> the</c> made and um you know how would the made and um you know how would the introduction<00:04:29.440><c> of</c> introduction of introduction of different<00:04:31.000><c> data</c><00:04:31.440><c> of</c><00:04:31.560><c> a</c><00:04:31.759><c> different</c><00:04:32.160><c> system</c> different data of a different system different data of a different system State<00:04:33.360><c> have</c><00:04:33.600><c> affected</c><00:04:34.199><c> the</c><00:04:34.360><c> system's</c> State have affected the

and</c><00:04:39.360><c> this</c><00:04:39.479><c> is</c><00:04:39.680><c> really</c><00:04:39.880><c> interesting</c><00:04:40.320><c> with</c> time and this is really interesting with time and this is really interesting with llms<00:04:41.720><c> and</c><00:04:41.880><c> so</c><00:04:42.240><c> this</c><00:04:42.320><c> is</c><00:04:42.520><c> kind</c><00:04:42.639><c> of</c><00:04:42.800><c> where</c><00:04:42.960><c> I've</c> llms and so this is kind of where I've llms and so this is kind of where I've been<00:04:43.960><c> thinking</c><00:04:44.320><c> about</c><00:04:44.639><c> this</c><00:04:45.199><c> because</c><00:04:46.199><c> one</c><00:04:46.360><c> of</c> been thinking about this because one of been thinking about this because one of the<00:04:46.759><c> things</c><00:04:47.639><c> I</c><00:04:48.639><c> believe</c><00:04:49.440><c> that</c><00:04:49.560><c> it's</c><00:04:49.800><c> possible</c> the things I believe that it's possible the things I believe that it's possible to<00:04:50.240><c> do</c><00:04:50.560><c> and</c><00:04:50.639><c> I</c><00:04:50.800><c> haven't</c><00:04:51.800><c> um</c><00:04:52.479><c> actually</c><00:04:53.320><c> fully</c> to do and I haven't um actually fully to do and I haven't um actually fully created<00:04:54.199><c> the</c><00:04:54.360><c> experiment</c><00:04:54.919><c> to</c><00:04:55.560><c> you</c><00:04:55.639><c> know</c><00:04:55.800><c> prove</c> created the experiment to you know prove created the experiment to you know prove or<00:04:56.199><c> disprove</c><00:04:56.800><c> this</c><00:04:57.800><c> but</c><00:04:58.039><c> basically</c><00:04:58.759><c> I</c><00:04:58.960><c> think</c> or disprove this but basically I think or disprove this but basically I think that<00:05:00.720><c> because</c><00:05:01.000><c> llms</c><00:05:01.560><c> have</c><00:05:01.800><c> all</c><00:05:01.919><c> of</c><00:05:02.080><c> this</c><00:05:02.280><c>

thing</c><00:05:04.600><c> you</c> compressed into them one thing you compressed into them one thing you should<00:05:04.919><c> be</c><00:05:05.080><c> able</c><00:05:05.280><c>

lot</c><00:06:52.400><c> of</c><00:06:52.680><c> really</c> think it there there are a lot of really think it there there are a lot of really interesting<00:06:53.360><c> things</c><00:06:53.639><c> that</c><00:06:53.759><c> we</c><00:06:53.880><c> can</c><00:06:54.039><c> get</c><00:06:54.240><c> out</c> interesting things that we can get out interesting things that we can get out of<00:06:54.960><c> the</c><00:06:55.120><c> the</c><00:06:55.240><c> highly</c><00:06:55.560><c> compressed</c><00:06:56.160><c> information</c> of the the highly compressed information of the the

guess</c><00:07:02.240><c> we'll</c><00:07:02.400><c> go</c><00:07:02.520><c> ahead</c><00:07:02.680><c> and</c> and so yeah I guess we'll go ahead and and so yeah I guess we'll go ahead and figure<00:07:03.000><c> out</c><00:07:03.160><c> if</c><00:07:03.280><c> we</c><00:07:03.360><c> can</c><00:07:03.520><c> use</c><00:07:03.680><c> them</c><00:07:03.879><c> to</c><00:07:04.720><c> time</c> figure out if we can use them to time figure out if we can use them to time travel<00:07:07.039><c> so</c><00:07:07.240><c> that's</c><00:07:07.360><c> the</c><00:07:07.479><c> next</c><00:07:07.720><c> experiment</c><00:07:08.080><c> up</c> travel so that's the next experiment up travel so that's the next experiment up on<00:07:08.319><c> the</c><00:07:08.520><c> list</c><00:07:09.520><c> and</c> on the list and on the list and um<00:07:11.599><c> yeah</c><00:07:11.800><c> I</c> um yeah I um yeah I think<00:07:13.720><c> kind</c><00:07:13.840><c> of</c><00:07:13.960><c> getting</c><00:07:14.199><c> back</c><00:07:14.360><c> to</c><00:07:14.479><c> that</c><00:07:14.599><c> whole</c> think kind of getting back to that whole think kind of

a</c><00:07:22.639><c> lot</c><00:07:22.759><c> of</c><00:07:22.840><c> times</c><00:07:23.000><c> we</c> in the past because a lot of times we in the past because a lot of times we think<00:07:23.280><c> about</c><00:07:23.440><c> outcomes</c><00:07:24.160><c> right</c> think about outcomes right think about outcomes right um<00:07:26.960><c> and</c><00:07:27.800><c> oh</c><00:07:27.960><c> well</c><00:07:28.160><c> that</c><00:07:28.280><c> didn't</c><00:07:28.520><c> go</c><00:07:28.759><c> well</c><00:07:29.360><c> uh</c><00:07:29.639><c> uh</c> um and oh well
