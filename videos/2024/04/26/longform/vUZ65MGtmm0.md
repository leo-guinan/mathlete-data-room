everything I do with probability uh everything I do with Quantum Quantum Quantum economics<00:00:41.680><c> it's</c><00:00:42.000><c> all</c><00:00:42.360><c> dealing</c><00:00:43.079><c> with</c><00:00:43.559><c> the</c> economics it's all dealing with the economics it's all dealing with the value<00:00:44.120><c> of</c><00:00:44.760><c> information</c> value of information value of

in uncertain ways you need to figure out in uncertain ways you need to figure out what<00:00:50.079><c> information</c><00:00:50.559><c> is</c><00:00:50.960><c> valuable</c><00:00:51.960><c> when</c><00:00:52.160><c> it's</c> what information is valuable when it's what information is valuable when it's valuable<00:00:53.440><c> and</c><00:00:53.640><c> you</c><00:00:53.760><c> need</c><00:00:53.960><c> to</c><00:00:54.039><c> put</c><00:00:54.160><c> it</c><00:00:54.239><c> all</c> valuable and you need to put it all valuable and you need to put it all together<00:00:54.760><c> into</c><00:00:55.399><c> some</c><00:00:55.680><c> sort</c><00:00:56.000><c> of</c><00:00:57.000><c> economic</c> together into some sort of economic together into some sort

I finally got me to learn probability I actually<00:01:14.200><c> hated</c><00:01:14.479><c> probability</c><00:01:14.960><c> in</c><00:01:15.119><c> school</c><00:01:15.520><c> I</c> actually hated probability in school I actually hated probability in school I love<00:01:16.040><c> all</c><00:01:16.159><c> sorts</c><00:01:16.400><c> of</c><00:01:16.759><c> like</c><00:01:17.119><c> higher</c><00:01:17.400><c> level</c> love all sorts of like higher level love all sorts of like higher level mathematics<00:01:19.200><c> hated</c> mathematics hated mathematics hated probability<00:01:21.520><c> and</c><00:01:21.640><c> then</c><00:01:21.759><c> I</c><00:01:21.840><c> started</c><00:01:22.079><c> playing</c> probability and then I started playing probability and then I started playing poker<00:01:23.560><c> and</c><00:01:24.040><c> I</c><00:01:24.200><c> started</c><00:01:24.720><c> to</c><00:01:25.680><c> love</c><00:01:26.000><c> probability</c> poker and I started to love probability poker and I started to love probability and<00:01:26.920><c> not</c><00:01:27.079><c> just</c><00:01:27.280><c> probability</c><00:01:27.799><c> but</c><00:01:27.960><c> also</c><00:01:28.240><c> Game</c> and not just probability but also Game and not just probability but also Game Theory<00:01:29.759><c> uh</c> Theory uh Theory uh and<00:01:31.759><c> even</c><00:01:32.040><c> human</c> and even human and even human psychology<00:01:34.000><c> a</c><00:01:34.200><c> lot</c><00:01:34.360><c> of</c><00:01:34.560><c> things</c><00:01:34.920><c> right</c><00:01:35.079><c> there's</c> psychology a lot of things right there's psychology a lot of things right there's a<00:01:35.520><c> lot</c><00:01:35.960><c> of</c><00:01:36.360><c>
