this person I really look up to admire this person I really look up to them<00:05:33.280><c> I</c><00:05:33.440><c> think</c><00:05:33.639><c> that</c><00:05:33.759><c> they</c><00:05:33.880><c> are</c><00:05:34.039><c> doing</c><00:05:34.280><c> a</c> them I think that they are doing a them I think that they are doing a wonderful<00:05:34.919><c> thing</c><00:05:35.880><c> and</c><00:05:36.039><c> when</c><00:05:36.160><c> I</c><00:05:36.280><c> thought</c><00:05:36.400><c> of</c><00:05:36.520><c> it</c> wonderful thing and when I thought of it wonderful thing and when I thought of it from<00:05:36.840><c> that</c><00:05:37.039><c> standpoint</c><00:05:37.600><c> I</c><00:05:37.720><c> was</c> from that standpoint I was from that standpoint I was like<00:05:39.600><c> the</c><00:05:39.759><c> whole</c><00:05:40.039><c> idea</c><00:05:40.680><c> that</c><00:05:40.840><c> they</c><00:05:40.960><c> would</c><00:05:41.199><c> just</c> like the whole idea that they would just like the whole idea that they would just reject<00:05:41.840><c> me</c><00:05:42.240><c> without</c><00:05:42.600><c> having</c><00:05:42.880><c> that</c> reject me without having that reject me without having that conversation<00:05:44.360><c> just</c><00:05:45.360><c> that</c><00:05:45.680><c> doesn't</c><00:05:46.039><c> actually</c> conversation just that doesn't actually conversation just that doesn't actually fit<00:05:46.759><c> who</c><00:05:46.960><c> they</c><00:05:47.080><c> are</c><00:05:47.319><c> at</c><00:05:47.440><c> all</c><00:05:48.319><c> and</c><00:05:48.440><c> I</c><00:05:48.560><c> knew</c><00:05:49.120><c> that</c> fit who they are at all and I knew that fit who they are at all and I knew that and<00:05:50.639><c> so</c><00:05:50.840><c> when</c><00:05:50.960><c> I</c><00:05:51.080><c> was</c><00:05:51.199><c> able</c><00:05:51.360><c> to</c><00:05:51.479><c> reframe</c><00:05:52.080><c> that</c> and so when I was able to reframe that and so when I was able to reframe that it<00:05:53.080><c> really</c><00:05:53.360><c> did</c><00:05:53.680><c> turn</c><00:05:53.800><c> it</c><00:05:54.000><c> into</c><00:05:54.440><c> an</c><00:05:54.600><c> overall</c> it really did turn it into an overall it really did turn it into an overall positive<00:05:55.319><c> experience</c><00:05:55.919><c> and</c><00:05:56.039><c> so</c><00:05:56.319><c> I</c><00:05:56.440><c> I</c><00:05:56.520><c> wanted</c><00:05:56.759><c> to</c> positive experience and so I I wanted to positive experience and so I I wanted to share<00:05:57.199><c> that</c><00:05:57.479><c> because</c><00:05:58.240><c> I</c><00:05:58.319><c> think</c><00:05:58.520><c> it's</c><00:05:58.720><c> such</c><00:05:58.919><c> a</c> share that because I think it's such a share that because I think it's such a powerful<00:05:59.800><c> way</c><00:06:00.000><c> to</c><00:06:00.319><c> just</c><00:06:01.319><c> reflame</c><00:06:02.199><c> reframe</c> powerful way to just reflame reframe powerful way to just reflame reframe that<00:06:02.880><c> situation</c><00:06:03.360><c> on</c><00:06:03.560><c> the</c><00:06:03.680><c> Fly</c><00:06:04.800><c> Right</c> that situation on the Fly Right that situation on the Fly Right like<00:06:08.599><c> we</c><00:06:08.680><c>
