about</c><00:00:41.840><c> the</c><00:00:42.239><c> concept</c><00:00:42.559><c> of</c><00:00:42.640><c> a</c><00:00:43.239><c> submind</c> talk about the concept of a submind talk about the concept of a submind and<00:00:46.000><c> what</c><00:00:46.280><c> this</c><00:00:46.600><c> entails</c><00:00:47.520><c> is</c><00:00:48.000><c> basically</c><00:00:48.920><c> it</c><00:00:49.120><c> is</c> and what this entails is basically it is and what this entails is basically it is a<00:00:50.600><c> subset</c><00:00:51.079><c> of</c><00:00:51.680><c> information</c><00:00:52.680><c>

if</c><00:00:54.559><c> you</c><00:00:54.760><c> kind</c><00:00:54.920><c> of</c><00:00:55.160><c> look</c><00:00:55.440><c> at</c><00:00:56.079><c> what</c><00:00:56.640><c> open</c><00:00:56.920><c> AI</c> know if you kind of look at what open AI know if you kind of look at what open AI is<00:00:57.359><c> doing</c><00:00:57.719><c> what</c><00:00:57.879><c> anthropic</c><00:00:58.359><c> is</c><00:00:58.480><c> doing</c><00:00:58.719><c> what</c> is doing what anthropic is doing what is doing what anthropic is doing what all<00:00:58.960><c> these</c><00:00:59.120><c> large</c><00:00:59.320><c> language</c><00:00:59.600><c> models</c><00:01:00.039><c> doing</c> all these large language models doing all these large language models doing they're<00:01:00.920><c> trying</c><00:01:01.199><c> to</c><00:01:01.440><c> pack</c><00:01:01.840><c> all</c><00:01:02.120><c> human</c> they're trying to pack all human they're trying to pack all human knowledge knowledge knowledge into<00:01:04.960><c> a</c><00:01:05.119><c> single</c><00:01:05.560><c> box</c><00:01:06.560><c> right</c><00:01:07.280><c> and</c><00:01:07.400><c> so</c><00:01:07.600><c> this</c><00:01:07.680><c> is</c> into a single box right and so this is into a single box right and so this is super<00:01:08.200><c> tight</c><00:01:08.439><c> compression</c><00:01:08.840><c> of</c><00:01:09.200><c> information</c> super tight compression of information super tight compression of information and<00:01:10.520><c> as</c><00:01:10.640><c> you</c><00:01:10.799><c> may</c><00:01:10.920><c> or</c><00:01:11.040><c> may</c><00:01:11.200><c> not</c><00:01:11.360><c> know</c><00:01:11.960><c> this</c> and as you may or may not know this and as you may or may not know this results<00:01:12.479><c> in</c><00:01:12.680><c> things</c><00:01:13.000><c> like</c><00:01:13.479><c> hallucinations</c> results in things like hallucinations results in things like hallucinations right<00:01:14.680><c> there's</c><00:01:14.960><c> no</c><00:01:15.200><c> idea</c><00:01:15.960><c> of</c><00:01:16.960><c> what's</c><00:01:17.280><c> true</c> right there's no idea of what's true right there's no idea of what's true what's<00:01:18.080><c> not</c><00:01:18.960><c> and</c><00:01:19.799><c> anything</c><00:01:20.159><c> like</c><00:01:20.360><c> that</c><00:01:20.799><c> and</c> what's not and anything like that and what's not and anything like that and there's<00:01:21.200><c> a</c><00:01:21.360><c> good</c><00:01:21.520><c>

human</c><00:01:43.799><c> intention</c><00:01:44.439><c> via</c><00:01:44.680><c> the</c><00:01:44.840><c> way</c> understand human intention via the way understand human intention via the way we<00:01:45.360><c> use</c><00:01:45.640><c> language</c><00:01:46.119><c> and</c><00:01:46.240><c> it</c><00:01:46.360><c> turns</c><00:01:46.640><c> out</c><00:01:46.920><c> that</c> we use language and it turns out that we use language and it turns out that we're<00:01:47.240><c> actually</c><00:01:47.640><c> really</c><00:01:48.000><c> bad</c><00:01:48.240><c> at</c> we're actually really bad at we're actually really bad at it<00:01:49.960><c> but</c><00:01:50.719><c> I've</c><00:01:50.960><c> been</c><00:01:51.200><c> working</c><00:01:51.479><c> on</c><00:01:51.640><c> this</c> it but I've been working on this it but I've been working on this different<00:01:52.079><c> approach</c><00:01:52.439><c> called</c><00:01:52.680><c> subm</c><00:01:53.000><c> mines</c><00:01:53.399><c> and</c> different approach called subm mines and different approach called subm mines and so<00:01:54.439><c> instead</c><00:01:55.399><c> of</c><00:01:56.399><c> trying</c><00:01:56.680><c> to</c><00:01:56.840><c> do</c><00:01:57.280><c> everything</c><00:01:57.680><c> in</c> so instead of trying to do everything in so instead of trying to do everything in kind<00:01:57.960><c> of</c><00:01:58.200><c> one</c><00:01:58.399><c> big</c><00:01:58.640><c> box</c><00:01:58.920><c> I</c><00:01:59.039><c> said</c><00:01:59.399><c> okay</c><00:01:59.600><c> well</c> kind of one big box I said okay well kind of one big box I said okay well what<00:02:00.119><c> if</c><00:02:00.439><c> what</c><00:02:00.520><c> we</c><00:02:00.640><c> need</c><00:02:00.840><c> is</c><00:02:00.960><c> an</c><00:02:01.159><c> actual</c><00:02:01.520><c> like</c> what if what we need is an actual like what if what we need is an actual like distributed<00:02:02.840><c> intelligence</c><00:02:03.840><c> and</c><00:02:04.159><c> what</c><00:02:04.320><c> this</c> distributed intelligence and what this distributed intelligence and what this looks<00:02:04.640><c> like</c><00:02:04.799><c> in</c><00:02:05.159><c> practice</c><00:02:06.200><c> is</c><00:02:07.200><c> having</c><00:02:08.119><c> like</c> looks like in practice is having like looks like in practice is having like one<00:02:08.800><c> mind</c><00:02:09.800><c> that</c><00:02:10.119><c> then</c><00:02:11.000><c> breaks</c><00:02:11.400><c> down</c><00:02:11.599><c> into</c> one mind that then breaks down into one mind that then breaks down into different<00:02:12.080><c> pieces</c><00:02:12.560><c> right</c><00:02:12.760><c> and</c><00:02:12.879><c> if</c><00:02:12.959><c> you</c><00:02:13.080><c> think</c> different pieces right and if you think different pieces right and if you think about<00:02:13.560><c> this</c><00:02:13.840><c> this</c><00:02:13.959><c> is</c><00:02:14.360><c> very</c><00:02:14.599><c> much</c><00:02:14.840><c> how</c><00:02:15.040><c> you</c> about this this is very much how you about this this is very much how you

here</c><00:03:00.680><c> is</c><00:03:00.920><c> like</c> um and and the nice thing here is like um and and the nice thing here is like basically<00:03:01.840><c> you</c><00:03:02.000><c> could</c><00:03:02.159><c> take</c><00:03:02.360><c> what</c><00:03:02.480><c> you</c><00:03:02.599><c> learn</c> basically you could take what you learn basically you could take what you learn and<00:03:03.319><c> then</c><00:03:03.480><c> scale</c><00:03:03.920><c> that</c><00:03:04.080><c> out</c><00:03:04.480><c> to</c><00:03:05.319><c> you</c><00:03:05.440><c> know</c><00:03:05.680><c> a</c> and then scale that out to you know a and then scale that out to you know a large<00:03:06.080><c> number</c><00:03:06.280><c> of</c><00:03:06.440><c> times</c><00:03:06.720><c> you</c><00:03:06.920><c> build</c><00:03:07.239><c> one</c> large number of times you build one large number of times you build one product<00:03:08.120><c> and</c><00:03:08.280><c> then</c><00:03:08.519><c> you</c><00:03:08.640><c> know</c><00:03:08.799><c> you</c><00:03:08.959><c> figure</c><00:03:09.239><c> out</c> product and then you know you figure out product and then you know you figure out how<00:03:09.760><c> to</c><00:03:10.760><c> build</c><00:03:11.040><c> it</c><00:03:11.200><c> for</c><00:03:11.480><c> less</c><00:03:11.680><c> than</c><00:03:11.799><c> you</c><00:03:11.920><c> can</c> how to build it for less than you can how to build it for less than you can sell<00:03:12.280><c> it</c><00:03:12.400><c> for</c><00:03:12.879><c> and</c><00:03:13.040><c> so</c><00:03:13.360><c> a</c><00:03:13.440><c> lot</c><00:03:13.560><c> of</c><00:03:13.680><c> this</c><00:03:13.760><c> is</c><00:03:13.920><c> just</c> sell it for and so a lot of this is just sell it for and so a lot of this is just trial<00:03:14.360><c> and</c><00:03:14.480><c> error</c><00:03:14.799><c> trying</c><00:03:15.000><c> to</c><00:03:15.120><c> figure</c><00:03:15.360><c> it</c><00:03:15.680><c> out</c> trial and error trying to figure it out trial and error trying to figure it out um<00:03:17.560><c> and</c><00:03:17.760><c> so</c><00:03:18.440><c> with</c><00:03:18.599><c> the</c><00:03:18.720><c> submind</c><00:03:19.400><c> what</c><00:03:19.519><c> I've</c> um and so with the submind what I've um and so with the submind what I've actually<00:03:20.040><c> done</c><00:03:20.360><c> now</c><00:03:20.879><c> is</c><00:03:21.080><c> I</c><00:03:21.239><c> have</c><00:03:21.360><c> it</c><00:03:21.519><c> set</c><00:03:21.760><c> up</c><00:03:22.000><c> to</c> actually done now is I have it set up to actually done now is I have it set up to where<00:03:23.519><c> I</c><00:03:23.799><c> can</c><00:03:24.040><c> give</c><00:03:24.159><c> it</c><00:03:24.360><c> a</c><00:03:24.599><c> topic</c><00:03:25.440><c> and</c><00:03:25.799><c> it</c><00:03:26.280><c> will</c> where I can give it a topic and it will where I can give it a topic and it will teach<00:03:27.599><c> itself</c><00:03:28.280><c> and</c><00:03:28.400><c> how</c><00:03:28.519><c> it</c><00:03:28.680><c> does</c><00:03:28.959><c> that</c><00:03:29.120><c> is</c><00:03:29.239><c> it</c> teach itself and how it does that is it teach itself and how it does that is it actually<00:03:29.799><c> uses</c><00:03:30.040><c> this</c><00:03:30.159><c> recursive</c><00:03:30.879><c> algorithm</c> actually uses this recursive algorithm actually uses this recursive algorithm to<00:03:32.680><c> generate</c><00:03:33.480><c> its</c><00:03:33.760><c> own</c><00:03:34.760><c> Subs</c><00:03:35.760><c> based</c><00:03:36.159><c> on</c><00:03:37.120><c> what</c> to generate its own Subs based on what to generate its own Subs based on what it<00:03:37.360><c> needs</c><00:03:37.560><c> to</c><00:03:37.760><c> learn</c><00:03:38.319><c> and</c><00:03:38.720><c> so</c><00:03:39.720><c> instead</c><00:03:40.080><c> of</c> it needs to learn and so instead of it needs to learn and so instead of using<00:03:41.599><c> um</c><00:03:42.519><c> like</c><00:03:42.640><c>

this</c><00:04:07.120><c> idea</c><00:04:07.560><c> of</c> that I'm building on top of this idea of that I'm building on top of this idea of a<00:04:08.319><c> submind</c><00:04:09.319><c> well</c><00:04:09.480><c> it's</c><00:04:09.640><c> actually</c><00:04:09.840><c> technically</c> a submind well it's actually technically a submind well it's actually technically the<00:04:10.400><c> second</c><00:04:10.959><c> um</c><00:04:11.120><c> first</c><00:04:11.360><c> is</c><00:04:11.480><c> my</c><00:04:11.640><c> AI</c><00:04:12.120><c> co-founder</c> the second um first is my AI co-founder the second um first is my AI co-founder um<00:04:13.879><c> which</c><00:04:14.120><c> hasn't</c><00:04:14.640><c> worked</c><00:04:15.079><c> as</c><00:04:15.239><c> well</c><00:04:15.560><c> as</c><00:04:15.760><c> I'd</c> um which hasn't worked as well as I'd um which hasn't worked as well as I'd hoped<00:04:16.199><c> and</c><00:04:16.320><c> so</c><00:04:16.560><c> that's</c><00:04:16.919><c> part</c><00:04:17.040><c> of</c><00:04:17.160><c> it</c><00:04:17.359><c> I</c><00:04:17.519><c> I</c> hoped and so that's part of it I I hoped and so that's part of it I I realized<00:04:18.040><c> I</c><00:04:18.160><c> need</c><00:04:18.280><c> to</c><00:04:18.440><c> kind</c><00:04:18.560><c> of</c><00:04:18.680><c> rethink</c><00:04:19.120><c> that</c> realized I need to kind of rethink that realized I need to kind of rethink that piece<00:04:19.479><c> of</c><00:04:19.600><c> it</c><00:04:20.440><c> um</c><00:04:20.919><c> and</c><00:04:21.000><c> so</c><00:04:21.239><c> right</c><00:04:21.400><c> now</c><00:04:21.639><c> I've</c> piece of it um and so right now I've piece of it um and so right now I've been<00:04:22.440><c> primarily</c><00:04:22.919><c> focused</c><00:04:23.320><c> on</c><00:04:23.520><c> on</c><00:04:23.759><c> product</c> been primarily focused on on product been primarily focused on on product development<00:04:24.479><c> for</c><00:04:24.800><c> this</c><00:04:25.800><c> um</c><00:04:26.560><c> tool</c><00:04:26.840><c> for</c><00:04:27.000><c> early</c> development for this um tool for early development for this um tool for early stage<00:04:27.560><c> investors</c><00:04:28.280><c> and</c><00:04:28.400><c> startup</c><00:04:28.759><c> Founders</c> stage investors and startup Founders stage investors and startup Founders actually actually actually and<00:04:32.000><c> so</c><00:04:33.000><c> what</c><00:04:33.160><c> it</c><00:04:33.280><c> does</c><00:04:33.639><c> now</c><00:04:34.240><c> is</c><00:04:34.600><c> I</c><00:04:34.800><c> say</c><00:04:35.600><c> okay</c><00:04:36.600><c> uh</c> and so what it does now is I say okay uh and so what it does now is I say okay uh learn<00:04:37.280><c> this</c><00:04:37.479><c> thing</c><00:04:37.720><c> and</c><00:04:37.840><c> it</c><00:04:37.960><c> says</c><00:04:38.320><c> great</c>

order to need or in order to learn this topic<00:04:46.039><c> I</c><00:04:46.160><c> need</c><00:04:46.440><c> to</c><00:04:46.639><c> know</c> topic I need to know topic I need to know about<00:04:49.199><c> these</c><00:04:49.479><c> three</c><00:04:49.720><c> to</c><00:04:49.919><c> five</c> about these three to five about these three to five topics<00:04:52.000><c> and</c><00:04:53.000><c> so</c><00:04:53.360><c> then</c><00:04:53.919><c> it</c><00:04:54.120><c> breaks</c><00:04:54.400><c> it</c><00:04:54.560><c> down</c> topics and so then it breaks it down topics and so then it breaks it down into<00:04:55.000><c> these</c><00:04:55.280><c> subcategories</c><00:04:56.280><c> and</c><00:04:56.479><c> then</c><00:04:57.280><c> it</c> into these subcategories and then it into these subcategories and then it actually<00:04:57.840><c> does</c><00:04:58.199><c> that</c><00:04:58.800><c> uh</c><00:04:58.919><c> a</c><00:04:59.039><c> couple</c><00:04:59.240><c> more</c> actually does that uh a couple more actually does that uh a couple more times<00:04:59.919><c> right</c><00:05:00.000><c> now</c><00:05:00.160><c> I've</c><00:05:00.280><c> only</c><00:05:00.440><c> got</c><00:05:00.560><c> it</c><00:05:00.680><c> three</c> times right now I've only got it three times right now I've only got it three levels<00:05:01.199><c> deep</c><00:05:01.720><c> because</c> levels deep because levels deep because um<00:05:04.400><c> it's</c><00:05:05.240><c> pretty</c><00:05:05.600><c> comprehensive</c><00:05:06.160><c> at</c><00:05:06.280><c> that</c> um it's pretty comprehensive at that um it's pretty comprehensive at that point<00:05:07.720><c> um</c><00:05:08.000><c> but</c><00:05:08.160><c> mostly</c><00:05:08.479><c> this</c><00:05:08.560><c> was</c><00:05:08.720><c> just</c><00:05:08.840><c> the</c> point um but mostly this was just the point um but mostly this was just the first<00:05:09.160><c> run</c><00:05:09.520><c> so</c><00:05:09.680><c> I</c><00:05:09.800><c> wanted</c><00:05:10.000><c> to</c><00:05:10.080><c> see</c><00:05:10.280><c> how</c><00:05:10.400><c> it</c><00:05:10.840><c> went</c> first run so I wanted to see how it went first run so I wanted to see how it went and<00:05:12.360><c> uh</c><00:05:12.960><c> so</c><00:05:13.199><c> then</c><00:05:13.360><c> what</c><00:05:13.479><c> it</c><00:05:13.680><c> does</c><00:05:14.520><c> is</c><00:05:15.520><c> it</c><00:05:15.759><c> kind</c> and uh so then what it does is it kind and uh so then what it does is it kind of<00:05:16.039><c> creates</c><00:05:16.600><c> this</c><00:05:17.240><c> structure</c><00:05:18.280><c> of</c><00:05:19.280><c> uh</c><00:05:19.479><c> tiered</c> of creates this structure of uh tiered of creates this structure of uh tiered sub<00:05:20.199><c> mines</c><00:05:20.759><c> that</c><00:05:21.440><c> learn</c><00:05:22.440><c> like</c><00:05:22.600><c> bits</c><00:05:22.840><c> and</c> sub mines that learn like bits and sub mines that learn like bits and pieces<00:05:23.680><c>

different topics and then it<00:05:26.039><c> kind</c><00:05:26.199><c> of</c><00:05:26.479><c> combines</c><00:05:26.960><c> that</c><00:05:27.120><c> knowledge</c><00:05:27.720><c> into</c> it kind

you</c> um kind of at the root right and so you um kind of at the root right and so you get<00:05:33.600><c> this</c><00:05:33.800><c> tree</c><00:05:34.120><c> structure</c><00:05:34.639><c> that's</c><00:05:34.919><c> actually</c> get this tree structure that's actually get this tree structure that's actually very<00:05:35.479><c> very</c><00:05:35.720><c> efficient</c><00:05:36.199><c> for</c><00:05:37.039><c> processing</c><00:05:37.479><c> data</c> very very efficient for processing data very very efficient for processing data and<00:05:38.160><c> more</c><00:05:38.400><c> importantly</c><00:05:39.160><c> like</c><00:05:39.759><c> doing</c><00:05:40.039><c> recalls</c> and more importantly like doing recalls and more importantly like doing recalls searching<00:05:41.160><c> data</c><00:05:42.160><c> um</c><00:05:43.000><c> and</c><00:05:43.560><c> so</c><00:05:44.560><c> the</c><00:05:44.759><c> fact</c><00:05:45.000><c> is</c> searching data um and so the fact is searching data um and so the fact is this<00:05:45.360><c> is</c> this is this is actually<00:05:47.199><c> super</c><00:05:47.520><c> cheap</c><00:05:47.759><c> to</c><00:05:48.360><c> run</c><00:05:49.560><c> um</c><00:05:50.560><c> and</c><00:05:51.160><c> you</c> actually super cheap to run um and you actually super cheap to run um and you know<00:05:51.680><c> it</c><00:05:51.919><c> it</c><00:05:52.120><c> basically</c><00:05:52.560><c> gives</c><00:05:52.759><c> you</c><00:05:53.039><c> this</c><00:05:53.680><c> like</c> know it it basically gives you this like know it it basically gives you this like it's<00:05:54.680><c> almost</c><00:05:54.919><c> like</c><00:05:55.080><c> a</c><00:05:55.360><c> fine-tuned</c><00:05:56.360><c> chat</c><00:05:56.639><c> model</c> it's almost like a fine-tuned chat model it's almost like a fine-tuned chat model that<00:05:57.160><c> you</c><00:05:57.280><c> can</c><00:05:57.520><c> chat</c><00:05:57.919><c> with</c><00:05:58.919><c> because</c><00:05:59.720><c> it</c><00:05:59.919><c> has</c> that you can chat with because it has that you can chat with because it has spent<00:06:01.319><c> the</c><00:06:01.639><c> you</c><00:06:01.759><c> know</c><00:06:02.080><c> time</c><00:06:02.880><c> learning</c><00:06:03.880><c> um</c> spent the you know time learning um spent the you know time learning um what's<00:06:05.039><c> important</c><00:06:05.520><c> and</c><00:06:05.639><c> so</c><00:06:05.840><c> what</c><00:06:05.960><c> you</c><00:06:06.080><c> do</c><00:06:06.319><c> is</c> what's important and so what you do is what's important and so what you do is you<00:06:06.560><c> can</c><00:06:06.800><c> basically</c><00:06:07.520><c> filter</c> you can basically filter you can basically filter information<00:06:10.039><c> through</c><00:06:10.520><c> this</c><00:06:11.039><c> like</c><00:06:11.560><c> submind</c> information through this like submind information through this like submind and<00:06:12.840><c> it</c><00:06:13.039><c> will</c><00:06:13.800><c> be</c><00:06:14.000><c> able</c><00:06:14.599><c> to</c><00:06:15.599><c> take</c><00:06:15.800><c> the</c><00:06:16.000><c> answer</c> and it will be able to take the answer and it will be able to take the answer and<00:06:16.639><c> craft</c><00:06:17.000><c> something</c><00:06:17.360><c> that</c><00:06:17.479><c> is</c><00:06:17.639><c> very</c><00:06:17.880><c> very</c> and craft something that is very very and craft something that is very very accurate<00:06:18.639><c> because</c><00:06:18.880><c> of</c><00:06:19.199><c> that</c><00:06:20.479><c> um</c> accurate because of that um accurate because of that um and<00:06:23.160><c> this</c><00:06:23.319><c> was</c><00:06:23.599><c> super</c><00:06:23.880><c> cool</c><00:06:24.199><c> I</c><00:06:24.280><c> was</c><00:06:24.520><c> actually</c> and this was super cool I was actually and this was super cool I was actually really<00:06:25.039><c> impressed</c><00:06:25.440><c> with</c><00:06:25.560><c> the</c><00:06:25.720><c> run</c><00:06:26.000><c> like</c><00:06:26.120><c> the</c> really impressed with the run like the really impressed with the run like the first<00:06:26.479><c> run</c><00:06:26.680><c> of</c><00:06:26.880><c> things</c><00:06:27.599><c> as</c><00:06:27.720><c> I</c><00:06:27.880><c> said</c><00:06:28.280><c> took</c><00:06:28.479><c> about</c> first run of things as I said took about first run of things as I said took about an<00:06:28.800><c> hour</c><00:06:29.759><c> um</c><00:06:30.000><c> and</c><00:06:30.120><c> I</c><00:06:30.240><c> didn't</c><00:06:30.520><c> actually</c><00:06:30.800><c> look</c><00:06:30.960><c> at</c> an hour um and I didn't actually look at an hour um and I didn't actually look at exactly<00:06:31.479><c> how</c><00:06:31.599><c> much</c><00:06:31.759><c> it</c><00:06:31.960><c> costs</c><00:06:32.960><c> um</c><00:06:33.319><c> but</c><00:06:33.880><c> it's</c> exactly how much it costs um but it's exactly how much it costs um but it's I'm<00:06:34.599><c> almost</c><00:06:34.800><c> certain</c><00:06:35.039><c> it's</c><00:06:35.199><c> under</c><00:06:35.360><c> $5</c><00:06:36.360><c> uh</c><00:06:36.639><c> it's</c> I'm almost certain it's under $5 uh it's I'm almost certain it's under $5 uh it's not<00:06:36.919><c> too</c><00:06:37.160><c> expensive</c><00:06:37.720><c> because</c><00:06:37.960><c> my</c><00:06:38.160><c> don't</c><00:06:38.319><c> have</c> not too expensive because my don't have not too expensive because my don't have that<00:06:38.599><c> much</c><00:06:38.759><c> in</c><00:06:38.840><c> my</c><00:06:38.960><c> open</c><00:06:39.160><c> AI</c><00:06:39.520><c> account</c><00:06:40.360><c> uh</c><00:06:40.520><c> and</c> that much in my open AI account uh and that much in my open AI account uh and it<00:06:40.759><c> didn't</c><00:06:41.080><c> automatically</c><00:06:41.919><c> recharge</c><00:06:42.560><c> itself</c> it didn't automatically recharge itself it didn't automatically recharge itself so<00:06:43.960><c> um</c><00:06:44.639><c> yeah</c><00:06:44.800><c> so</c><00:06:45.000><c> it</c><00:06:45.080><c> definitely</c><00:06:45.400><c> wasn't</c> so um yeah so it definitely wasn't so um yeah so it definitely wasn't expensive<00:06:46.120><c> to</c><00:06:46.280><c> do</c><00:06:47.120><c> uh</c><00:06:47.240><c> and</c><00:06:47.360><c> I</c><00:06:47.440><c> think</c><00:06:47.599><c> I</c><00:06:47.720><c> can</c> expensive to do uh and I think I can expensive to do uh and I think I can actually<00:06:48.120><c> make</c><00:06:48.319><c> it</c><00:06:48.960><c> um</c><00:06:49.960><c> probably</c><00:06:50.440><c> faster</c><00:06:51.240><c> and</c> actually make it um probably faster and actually make it um probably faster and cheaper<00:06:52.479><c> uh</c><00:06:52.599><c> in</c><00:06:52.720><c> a</c><00:06:52.800><c> number</c><00:06:53.000><c> of</c><00:06:53.120><c> different</c><00:06:53.319><c> ways</c> cheaper uh in a number of different ways cheaper uh in a number of different ways but<00:06:54.199><c> the</c><00:06:54.319><c> cool</c><00:06:54.520><c> thing</c><00:06:54.680><c> is</c><00:06:54.840><c> really</c><00:06:55.199><c> the</c><00:06:55.440><c> the</c> but the cool thing is really the the but the cool thing is really the the architecture<00:06:56.919><c> uh</c><00:06:57.120><c> not</c><00:06:57.360><c> necessarily</c><00:06:57.879><c> the</c> architecture uh not necessarily the architecture uh not necessarily the model<00:06:59.000><c> um</c><00:06:59.800><c> and</c><00:06:59.919><c> you</c><00:07:00.039><c> know</c><00:07:00.160><c> I</c><00:07:00.280><c> could</c><00:07:00.440><c> even</c> model um and you know I could even model um and you know I could even probably<00:07:01.240><c> set</c><00:07:01.440><c> up</c><00:07:01.560><c> a</c><00:07:01.639><c> model</c><00:07:01.879><c> to</c><00:07:02.000><c> run</c><00:07:02.199><c> locally</c> probably set up a model to run locally probably set up a model to run locally and<00:07:02.720><c> do</c><00:07:02.840><c> it</c><00:07:03.240><c> way</c><00:07:03.680><c> cheaper</c><00:07:04.120><c> even</c><00:07:04.360><c> than</c><00:07:04.639><c> that</c><00:07:05.160><c> so</c> and do it way cheaper even than that so and do it way cheaper even than that so uh<00:07:07.120><c> yeah</c><00:07:07.319><c> this</c><00:07:07.440><c> is</c><00:07:07.639><c> super</c><00:07:07.960><c> exciting</c><00:07:08.560><c> because</c> uh yeah this is super exciting because uh yeah this is super exciting because it<00:07:09.800><c> gives</c><00:07:10.520><c> us</c><00:07:10.879><c> the</c><00:07:11.039><c> ability</c><00:07:11.479><c> to</c><00:07:11.680><c> do</c><00:07:12.879><c> um</c><00:07:13.879><c> so</c><00:07:14.120><c> many</c> it gives us the ability to do um so many it gives us the ability to do um so many different<00:07:14.680><c> things</c><00:07:15.440><c> like</c><00:07:16.440><c> uh</c><00:07:16.599><c> you</c><00:07:16.680><c> could</c><00:07:17.039><c> have</c> different things

a</c><00:10:49.720><c> very</c><00:10:49.920><c> interesting</c><00:10:50.920><c> way</c><00:10:51.279><c> to</c><00:10:51.639><c> even</c><00:10:51.959><c> just</c> it's a very interesting way to even just it's a very interesting way to even just organize<00:10:52.839><c> knowledge</c><00:10:53.440><c> and</c><00:10:53.639><c> so</c><00:10:54.639><c> um</c><00:10:55.160><c> one</c><00:10:55.320><c> of</c><00:10:55.440><c> the</c> organize knowledge and so um one of the organize knowledge and so um one of the ideas<00:10:55.880><c> down</c><00:10:56.040><c> the</c><00:10:56.200><c> line</c><00:10:56.399><c> is</c><00:10:56.600><c> actually</c><00:10:56.800><c> letting</c> ideas down the line is actually letting ideas down the line is actually letting
