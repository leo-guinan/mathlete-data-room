this</c><00:11:24.440><c> idea</c> schooling has designed around this idea schooling has designed around this idea that<00:11:25.320><c> like</c><00:11:26.320><c> school</c><00:11:27.079><c> like</c><00:11:27.560><c> information</c><00:11:28.120><c> is</c> that like school like information is that like school like information is something<00:11:28.639><c> you</c><00:11:28.800><c> can't</c><00:11:29.040><c> just</c><00:11:29.440><c> get</c><00:11:29.680><c> everywhere</c> something you can't just get everywhere something you can't just get everywhere and<00:11:30.480><c> now</c><00:11:30.639><c> we've</c><00:11:30.839><c> actually</c><00:11:31.079><c> got</c><00:11:31.200><c> the</c><00:11:31.320><c> complete</c> and now we've actually got the complete and now we've actually got the complete opposite<00:11:32.200><c> problem</c><00:11:32.760><c> of</c><00:11:33.200><c> there's</c><00:11:33.519><c> information</c> opposite problem of there's information opposite problem of there's information everywhere<00:11:34.959><c> so</c><00:11:35.120><c> how</c><00:11:35.240><c> do</c><00:11:35.360><c> you</c><00:11:35.560><c> actually</c><00:11:36.040><c> filter</c> everywhere so how do you actually filter everywhere so how do you actually filter that<00:11:36.680><c> down</c><00:11:36.880><c> into</c><00:11:37.120><c> what's</c><00:11:37.519><c>

and<00:11:42.040><c> so</c><00:11:42.279><c> like</c><00:11:42.440><c> I</c><00:11:42.519><c> think</c><00:11:42.680><c> you</c><00:11:42.760><c> know</c><00:11:42.880><c> when</c><00:11:43.000><c>

me</c><00:43:33.280><c> is</c><00:43:33.680><c> that</c><00:43:34.680><c> I</c><00:43:34.800><c> really</c><00:43:35.079><c> think</c> occurred to me is that I really think occurred to me is that I really think creativity creativity creativity happens happens happens like<00:43:39.839><c> whe</c><00:43:40.119><c> like</c><00:43:40.480><c> it</c><00:43:40.640><c> happens</c><00:43:41.040><c> more</c><00:43:41.480><c> when</c> like whe like it happens more when like whe like it happens more when you're<00:43:42.160><c> like</c><00:43:42.359><c> at</c><00:43:42.520><c> a</c><00:43:42.680><c> higher</c><00:43:43.000><c> energy</c><00:43:43.359><c> state</c> you're like at a higher energy state you're like at a higher energy state right<00:43:43.839><c> like</c><00:43:43.960><c> so</c><00:43:44.040><c> if</c><00:43:44.119><c> you</c><00:43:44.200><c> think</c><00:43:44.319><c> of</c><00:43:44.400><c> yourself</c> right like so if you think of yourself right like so if you think of yourself as<00:43:44.720><c> a</c><00:43:45.119><c> battery</c><00:43:46.119><c> um</c><00:43:47.040><c> when</c><00:43:47.160><c> you</c><00:43:47.400><c> have</c><00:43:47.680><c> like</c><00:43:47.839><c> a</c><00:43:47.960><c> lot</c> as a battery um when you have like a lot as a battery um when you have like a lot of<00:43:48.240><c> energy</c><00:43:48.559><c> and</c><00:43:48.720><c> that</c><00:43:48.880><c> energy</c><00:43:49.400><c> isn't</c><00:43:50.400><c> directly</c> of energy and that energy isn't directly of energy and that energy isn't directly focused<00:43:51.319><c> into</c><00:43:51.720><c> like</c><00:43:52.440><c> whatever</c><00:43:53.000><c> you</c><00:43:53.119><c> know</c> focused into like whatever you know focused into like whatever you know you're<00:43:53.640><c> doing</c><00:43:54.640><c> um</c><00:43:55.359><c> basically</c><00:43:55.800><c> the</c><00:43:55.920><c> brain</c><00:43:56.240><c> can</c> you're doing um basically the brain can you're doing um basically the brain can like<00:43:56.720><c> leave</c><00:43:57.200><c> some</c><00:43:57.319><c> of</c><00:43:57.440><c> that</c><00:43:57.559><c> off</c><00:43:57.800><c> into</c><00:43:58.079><c> like</c> like leave some of that off into like like leave some of that off into like background<00:43:58.720><c> processing</c><00:43:59.319><c> right</c><00:43:59.559><c> like</c><00:43:59.720><c> and</c> background processing right like and background processing right like and just<00:44:00.520><c> start</c><00:44:00.839><c> making</c><00:44:01.160><c> these</c> just start making these just start making these connections<00:44:03.200><c> um</c><00:44:04.200><c> and</c><00:44:04.400><c> that's</c><00:44:04.599><c> why</c><00:44:04.760><c> I</c><00:44:04.839><c> think</c> connections um and that's why I think connections um and that's why I think you<00:44:05.319><c> know</c><00:44:05.680><c> like</c><00:44:06.000><c> creativity</c><00:44:06.520><c> like</c><00:44:06.640><c> people</c> you know like creativity like people you know like creativity like people think<00:44:06.960><c> of</c><00:44:07.040><c> it</c><00:44:07.160><c> in</c><00:44:07.240><c> the</c><00:44:07.359><c> shower</c><00:44:07.760><c> right</c><00:44:07.920><c> like</c> think of it in the shower right like think of it in the shower right like your<00:44:08.160><c> brain's</c><00:44:08.480><c> not</c><00:44:08.640><c> doing</c><00:44:08.920><c> a</c><00:44:09.119><c> lot</c><00:44:09.240><c> of</c><00:44:09.359><c> work</c> your brain's not doing a lot of work your brain's not doing a lot of work processing<00:44:11.240><c> um</c><00:44:11.720><c> it's</c><00:44:11.920><c> not</c><00:44:12.119><c> expending</c><00:44:12.640><c> energy</c> processing um it's not expending energy processing um it's not expending energy and<00:44:13.880><c> so</c><00:44:14.839><c> like</c><00:44:15.319><c> and</c><00:44:15.480><c> same</c><00:44:15.720><c> thing</c><00:44:15.920><c> like</c><00:44:16.079><c> walking</c> and so like

the</c><00:48:47.800><c> ideas</c><00:48:48.119><c> I've</c><00:48:48.240><c> been</c> wish watch one of the ideas I've been wish watch one of the ideas I've been kicking<00:48:48.720><c> around</c><00:48:49.240><c> is</c><00:48:49.400><c> the</c><00:48:49.599><c> idea</c><00:48:50.079><c> of</c><00:48:50.720><c> uh</c> kicking around is the idea of uh kicking around is the idea of uh essentially<00:48:51.400><c> engineering</c> essentially engineering essentially engineering generosity<00:48:53.559><c> right</c><00:48:53.880><c> and</c><00:48:54.119><c> so</c><00:48:55.079><c> kind</c><00:48:55.200><c> of</c><00:48:55.359><c> one</c><00:48:55.440><c> of</c> generosity right and so kind of one of generosity right and so kind of one of my<00:48:55.720><c> core</c><00:48:55.960><c> beliefs</c><00:48:56.520><c> is</c> my core beliefs is my core beliefs is that<00:48:58.240><c> what</c><00:48:58.440><c> basically</c><00:48:58.920><c> finding</c><00:48:59.319><c> ways</c><00:48:59.640><c> to</c><00:49:00.040><c> get</c> that what basically finding ways to get that what basically finding ways to get people<00:49:00.520><c>

trying</c><00:49:06.200><c> to</c> yeah so I think um I'm trying to yeah so I think um I'm trying to understand<00:49:06.760><c> what</c><00:49:06.880><c> you</c><00:49:06.960><c> mean</c><00:49:07.200><c> when</c><00:49:07.319><c> you</c><00:49:07.400><c> say</c> understand what you mean when you say understand what you mean when you say engineering<00:49:08.160><c> General</c><00:49:08.760><c> right</c><00:49:09.440><c> so</c><00:49:09.680><c> so</c> engineering General right so so engineering General right so so basically<00:49:10.599><c> setting</c><00:49:11.040><c> up</c> basically setting up basically setting up um<00:49:13.559><c> systems</c><00:49:14.280><c> to</c><00:49:14.720><c> so</c><00:49:15.200><c> you</c><00:49:15.280><c> know</c><00:49:15.400><c> one</c><00:49:15.520><c> of</c><00:49:15.599><c> the</c> um systems to so you know one of the um systems to so you know one of the things<00:49:15.920><c> that</c><00:49:16.079><c> I</c><00:49:16.200><c> think</c><00:49:17.200><c> is</c><00:49:18.119><c> um</c><00:49:18.520><c> really</c> things that I think is um really things that I think is um really important<00:49:19.400><c> and</c><00:49:19.520><c> so</c><00:49:20.000><c> this</c><00:49:20.119><c> is</c><00:49:20.400><c> kind</c><00:49:20.520><c> of</c><00:49:20.640><c> more</c><00:49:20.799><c> of</c> important and so this is kind of more of important and so this is kind of more of the<00:49:21.040><c> economic</c><00:49:21.480><c> principles</c><00:49:21.920><c> of</c><00:49:22.040><c> it</c><00:49:23.040><c> um</c><00:49:23.520><c> money</c> the economic principles of it um money the economic principles of it um money is<00:49:23.960><c> only</c><00:49:24.200><c> useful</c><00:49:24.559><c> when</c><00:49:24.720><c> it's</c><00:49:25.200><c> moving</c><00:49:26.200><c> um</c> is only useful when it's moving um is only useful when it's moving um because<00:49:26.920><c> every</c><00:49:27.079><c> time</c><00:49:27.240><c> money</c><00:49:27.480><c> moves</c><00:49:28.040><c> that's</c> because every time money moves that's because every time money moves that's information<00:49:28.880><c> being</c><00:49:29.160><c> transmitted</c><00:49:29.920><c> and</c><00:49:30.119><c> so</c> information being transmitted and so information being transmitted and so when<00:49:31.079><c> people</c><00:49:31.359><c> don't</c><00:49:31.640><c> have</c><00:49:31.760><c> the</c><00:49:31.880><c> money</c><00:49:32.160><c> to</c> when people don't have the money to when people don't have the money to spend<00:49:32.599><c> on</c><00:49:32.839><c> stuff</c><00:49:33.160><c> that's</c><00:49:33.440><c> actually</c><00:49:34.359><c> not</c> spend on stuff that's actually not spend on stuff that's actually not creating<00:49:35.720><c> any</c><00:49:35.960><c> information</c><00:49:36.520><c> that</c><00:49:36.640><c> can</c><00:49:36.760><c> then</c> creating any information that can then creating any information that can then be<00:49:37.079><c> used</c><00:49:37.599><c> to</c><00:49:38.599><c> continue</c><00:49:39.000><c> the</c><00:49:39.160><c> economy</c><00:49:39.520><c> flowing</c> be used to continue the economy flowing be used to continue the economy flowing right<00:49:40.480><c>

that</c><00:50:24.720><c> stuff</c><00:50:25.079><c> is</c> there I think a lot of that stuff is there I think a lot of that stuff is actually actually actually um<00:50:27.599><c> like</c><00:50:28.319><c> mathematical</c><00:50:28.880><c> principles</c><00:50:29.440><c> and</c> um like mathematical principles and um like mathematical principles and science<00:50:30.480><c> that</c><00:50:30.640><c> was</c><00:50:31.280><c> recognized</c><00:50:32.280><c> and</c><00:50:32.440><c> they</c> science that was recognized and they science that was recognized and they just<00:50:32.760><c> didn't</c><00:50:33.079><c> have</c><00:50:33.280><c> the</c><00:50:33.400><c> right</c><00:50:33.640><c> words</c><00:50:34.000><c> to</c> just didn't have the right words to

it's</c><00:50:36.160><c> it's</c> describe it right and so it it's it's describe it right and so it it's it's pattern<00:50:36.920><c> matching</c><00:50:37.319><c> and</c><00:50:37.440><c> it's</c><00:50:37.640><c> pattern</c> pattern matching and it's pattern pattern matching and it's pattern recognition<00:50:39.640><c> um</c><00:50:40.079><c> with</c><00:50:40.280><c>

it's</c><00:51:00.359><c> only</c><00:51:00.559><c> useful</c> sense to be you know it's only useful sense to be you know it's only useful when<00:51:01.040><c> it's</c><00:51:01.200><c> being</c><00:51:01.720><c> spent</c><00:51:02.720><c> um</c><00:51:03.119><c> but</c><00:51:03.280><c> the</c><00:51:03.400><c> thing</c> when it's being spent um but the thing when it's being spent um but the thing is is is people<00:51:05.760><c> tend</c><00:51:06.119><c> to</c><00:51:06.319><c> not</c><00:51:06.480><c> want</c><00:51:06.599><c> to</c><00:51:06.720><c>

Systems</c><00:52:07.400><c> that</c><00:52:08.400><c> um</c><00:52:09.040><c> allow</c><00:52:09.440><c> people</c><00:52:09.720><c> to</c> Building Systems that um allow people to Building Systems that um allow people to have<00:52:10.160><c> that</c><00:52:10.280><c> sense</c><00:52:10.480><c> of</c><00:52:10.960><c> security</c><00:52:11.960><c> and</c><00:52:12.240><c> when</c> have that

feel</c><00:52:14.000><c> safe</c><00:52:14.319><c> and</c> they see like when they feel safe and they see like when they feel safe and when<00:52:14.559><c> they</c><00:52:14.680><c> see</c><00:52:14.960><c> other</c><00:52:15.200><c> people</c><00:52:15.400><c> being</c> when they see other people being when they see other people being generous<00:52:16.760><c> then</c><00:52:16.920><c> they're</c><00:52:17.079><c> more</c><00:52:17.280><c> willing</c><00:52:17.520><c> to</c><00:52:17.680><c> be</c> generous then they're more willing to be generous then

actually</c><00:52:29.520><c> think</c> generous and you know I actually think generous and you know I actually think it's<00:52:30.040><c> funny</c><00:52:30.319><c> but</c><00:52:30.440><c> I</c><00:52:30.520><c> think</c><00:52:30.680><c> Mr</c><00:52:30.960><c> Beast</c><00:52:31.319><c> is</c> it's funny but I think Mr Beast is it's funny but I think Mr Beast is actually<00:52:32.400><c> a</c><00:52:32.520><c> good</c><00:52:32.720><c> example</c><00:52:33.040><c> of</c><00:52:33.160><c> someone</c><00:52:33.480><c> who</c> actually a good example of someone who actually a good example of someone who is<00:52:35.240><c> essentially</c><00:52:35.640><c> trying</c><00:52:35.880><c> to</c><00:52:36.000><c> do</c><00:52:36.200><c> that</c><00:52:36.319><c> with</c><00:52:36.440><c> a</c> is essentially trying to do that with a is essentially trying to do that with a lot<00:52:36.640><c> of</c><00:52:36.720><c> the</c><00:52:36.839><c> stuff</c><00:52:37.040><c> he</c><00:52:37.160><c> does</c><00:52:37.599><c> like</c><00:52:37.760><c> sure</c><00:52:38.240><c> they</c> lot of the stuff he does like sure they lot of the stuff he does like sure they they're<00:52:38.599><c> kind</c><00:52:38.960><c> of</c><00:52:39.960><c> know</c><00:52:40.119><c> about</c><00:52:40.319><c> him</c><00:52:40.559><c> yeah</c> they're kind of know about him yeah they're kind of know about him yeah stunts<00:52:41.480><c> but</c><00:52:41.720><c> like</c><00:52:42.079><c> he</c><00:52:42.720><c> he</c><00:52:43.079><c> puts</c><00:52:43.359><c> money</c><00:52:43.680><c> into</c> stunts but like he he puts money into stunts but like he he puts money into good good good things<00:52:46.200><c> which</c><00:52:46.359><c> then</c><00:52:46.520><c> generates</c><00:52:46.960><c> more</c><00:52:47.119><c> money</c> things which then generates more money things which then generates more money which<00:52:47.720><c> then</c><00:52:47.920><c> he</c><00:52:48.160><c> has</c><00:52:48.440><c> more</c><00:52:48.680><c> money</c><00:52:49.040><c> to</c><00:52:49.760><c> and</c><00:52:49.880><c> so</c> which then he has more money to and so which then he has more money to and so when<00:52:50.200><c> people</c><00:52:50.520><c> see</c> when people see when people see that<00:52:52.440><c> that</c><00:52:53.040><c> tends</c><00:52:53.359><c> to</c><00:52:53.599><c> trigger</c><00:52:54.040><c> more</c><00:52:54.200><c> and</c><00:52:54.359><c> more</c> that that tends to trigger more and more that that tends to trigger more and more generosity<00:52:55.359><c> so</c><00:52:55.839><c> it</c><00:52:55.960><c> it</c><00:52:56.079><c> feels</c><00:52:56.640><c> weird</c><00:52:57.040><c> because</c> generosity so it it feels weird because generosity so it it feels weird because it's<00:52:57.400><c> like</c><00:52:57.640><c> oh</c><00:52:57.839><c> well</c><00:52:58.079><c> like</c><00:52:58.240><c> is</c><00:52:58.440><c> this</c><00:52:58.599><c> like</c><00:52:58.720><c> a</c> it's like oh well like is this like a it's like oh well like is this like a spectacle<00:52:59.440><c> and</c><00:52:59.559><c> the</c><00:52:59.680><c> answer</c><00:52:59.960><c> is</c><00:53:00.480><c> doesn't</c> spectacle and the answer is doesn't spectacle and the answer is doesn't actually<00:53:01.040><c> matter</c><00:53:01.400><c> it</c><00:53:01.480><c> is</c><00:53:01.640><c> a</c><00:53:01.880><c> good</c><00:53:02.079><c> Force</c><00:53:02.400><c> for</c> actually matter it is a good Force for actually matter it is a good Force for the<00:53:02.720><c> world</c><00:53:03.480><c> because</c><00:53:04.480><c> he's</c><00:53:04.880><c> you</c><00:53:05.000><c> know</c><00:53:05.319><c> putting</c> the world because he's you know putting the world because he's you know putting money<00:53:05.839><c> out</c><00:53:06.200><c> in</c><00:53:06.359><c> into</c><00:53:06.599><c> things</c><00:53:06.880><c> that</c><00:53:07.000><c> need</c><00:53:07.240><c> it</c><00:53:08.240><c> um</c> money out in into things that need it um money out in into things that need it um and<00:53:08.559><c> then</c><00:53:08.760><c> people</c><00:53:09.119><c> see</c><00:53:09.480><c> that</c><00:53:09.640><c> level</c><00:53:09.880><c> of</c> and then people see that level of and then people see that level of generosity<00:53:10.839><c> and</c><00:53:10.960><c> then</c><00:53:11.119><c> start</c><00:53:11.400><c> emulating</c><00:53:12.040><c> that</c> generosity and then start emulating that generosity and then start emulating that um<00:53:13.400><c> and</c><00:53:13.520><c> and</c><00:53:13.640><c> so</c><00:53:13.920><c> I</c><00:53:14.040><c> really</c><00:53:14.280><c> do</c><00:53:14.480><c> think</c><00:53:14.640><c> it</c><00:53:14.760><c> is</c> um and and so I really do think it is um and and so I really do think it is possible<00:53:15.440><c> that</c><00:53:15.559><c> to</c><00:53:15.680><c> have</c><00:53:15.880><c> things</c><00:53:16.119><c> like</c><00:53:16.319><c> that</c> possible that to have things like that possible that to have things like that that<00:53:16.680><c> are</c><00:53:16.880><c> just</c><00:53:17.119><c> these</c><00:53:17.440><c> these</c><00:53:17.599><c> systems</c><00:53:18.119><c> that</c> that are just these these systems that that are just these these systems that do<00:53:18.960><c>
