like</c><00:02:15.480><c> oh</c><00:02:15.640><c> that's</c><00:02:15.800><c> great</c><00:02:16.040><c> what</c><00:02:16.160><c> would</c> and it's like oh that's great what would and it's like oh that's great what would that<00:02:16.480><c> cost</c><00:02:17.080><c> me</c><00:02:18.080><c> and</c><00:02:18.280><c> so</c><00:02:19.000><c> I</c><00:02:19.239><c> did</c><00:02:19.440><c> some</c><00:02:19.720><c> quick</c> that cost me and so I did some quick that cost me and so I did some quick outlining<00:02:20.360><c> and</c><00:02:20.519><c> I</c><00:02:20.599><c> was</c><00:02:20.840><c> like</c><00:02:21.360><c> okay</c> outlining and I was like okay outlining and I was like okay so<00:02:23.319><c> let's</c><00:02:23.560><c> see</c><00:02:24.239><c> I</c><00:02:24.480><c> figure</c><00:02:25.319><c> that</c><00:02:25.480><c> I</c><00:02:25.599><c> could</c><00:02:25.800><c> make</c> so let's see I figure that I could make so let's see I figure that I could make this<00:02:26.280><c> worth</c><00:02:26.760><c> at</c><00:02:27.000><c> least</c><00:02:27.560><c> $100,000</c> and<00:02:31.840><c> so</c><00:02:32.239><c> to</c><00:02:32.480><c> me</c><00:02:33.480><c> 10,000</c><00:02:34.280><c> was</c><00:02:34.400><c> a</c><00:02:34.599><c> fair</c><00:02:35.400><c> estimate</c> and so to me 10,000 was a fair estimate and so to me 10,000 was a fair estimate and<00:02:36.599><c> so</c><00:02:37.200><c> I</c><00:02:37.319><c> sent</c><00:02:37.599><c> that</c><00:02:37.800><c> I</c><00:02:37.879><c> was</c><00:02:38.040><c> like</c><00:02:38.319><c> yeah</c><00:02:38.720><c> fig</c> and so I sent that I was like yeah fig and so I sent that I was like yeah fig we<00:02:39.080><c> could</c><00:02:39.159><c>

that</c><00:04:09.879><c> that's</c><00:04:10.040><c> the</c> I'll be able to finish that that's the I'll be able to finish that that's the idea<00:04:10.439><c> of</c><00:04:10.560><c> scarcity</c><00:04:11.000><c> in</c><00:04:11.120><c> a</c><00:04:11.280><c> nutshell</c><00:04:12.280><c> and</c><00:04:12.360><c> so</c><00:04:12.560><c> I</c> idea of scarcity in a nutshell and so I idea of scarcity in a nutshell and so I built<00:04:13.000><c> this</c><00:04:13.280><c> like</c><00:04:13.599><c> scarce</c><00:04:14.079><c> system</c><00:04:14.480><c> where</c><00:04:14.680><c> I</c> built this like scarce system where I built this like scarce system where I had<00:04:15.079><c> to</c><00:04:16.040><c> kind</c><00:04:16.359><c> of</c><00:04:17.359><c> war</c><00:04:17.759><c> game</c><00:04:18.199><c> the</c><00:04:18.560><c> different</c> had to kind of war game the different had to kind of war game the different interactions<00:04:20.519><c> and</c><00:04:21.000><c> figure</c><00:04:21.359><c> out</c><00:04:21.959><c> like</c><00:04:22.639><c> what</c> interactions and figure out like what interactions and figure out like what would<00:04:22.960><c> look</c><00:04:23.160><c> good</c><00:04:23.320><c> for</c><00:04:23.560><c> the</c><00:04:23.919><c> client</c><00:04:24.520><c> and</c><00:04:24.720><c> what</c> would look good for the client and what would look good for the client and what would<00:04:24.960><c> be</c><00:04:25.080><c> good</c><00:04:25.240><c> for</c><00:04:25.400><c> me</c><00:04:26.400><c> and</c><00:04:26.759><c> you</c><00:04:26.880><c> know</c><00:04:27.120><c> kind</c> would be good for me and you know kind would be good for me and you know kind of<00:04:27.360><c> ballpark</c><00:04:27.919><c> all</c><00:04:28.040><c> of</c><00:04:28.160><c> that</c><00:04:28.320><c> into</c><00:04:28.600><c> a</c><00:04:28.759><c> nice</c><00:04:29.000><c> big</c> of ballpark all of that into a nice big of ballpark all of that into a nice big number number number but<00:04:31.560><c> that's</c><00:04:31.759><c> scarcity</c><00:04:32.360><c> that's</c><00:04:32.520><c> not</c><00:04:32.720><c> abundance</c> but that's scarcity that's not abundance but that's scarcity that's not abundance so<00:04:33.759><c> what</c><00:04:33.880><c> does</c><00:04:34.039><c> abundance</c><00:04:34.400><c> look</c><00:04:34.560><c> like</c> so what does abundance look like so what does abundance look like instead<00:04:36.360><c> um</c><00:04:36.960><c> and</c><00:04:37.120><c> actually</c><00:04:37.360><c> I</c><00:04:37.479><c> even</c><00:04:37.680><c> sent</c><00:04:37.919><c> this</c> instead um and actually I even sent this instead um and actually I even sent this out<00:04:38.280><c> in</c><00:04:38.400><c> an</c><00:04:39.000><c> email</c><00:04:40.039><c> um</c><00:04:41.039><c> and</c><00:04:41.160><c> said</c><00:04:41.520><c> hey</c><00:04:41.800><c> you</c><00:04:41.919><c> know</c> out in an email um and said hey you know out in an email um and said hey you know I<00:04:42.120><c> was</c><00:04:42.320><c> actually</c><00:04:42.560><c> working</c><00:04:42.800><c> on</c><00:04:42.960><c> my</c><00:04:43.160><c> book</c><00:04:44.160><c> and</c> I was actually working on my book and I was actually working on my book and realized<00:04:45.520><c> that</c><00:04:46.199><c> that</c><00:04:46.400><c> price</c><00:04:46.639><c> wasn't</c><00:04:46.880><c> in</c> realized that that price wasn't in realized that that price wasn't in alignment<00:04:47.840><c> with</c><00:04:48.199><c> what</c><00:04:48.320><c> I</c><00:04:48.400><c> want</c><00:04:48.520><c> to</c><00:04:48.600><c> be</c><00:04:48.720><c> doing</c> alignment with what I want to be doing alignment with what I want to be doing and<00:04:49.840><c> so</c><00:04:50.080><c> I</c> and so I and so I said<00:04:52.039><c> let's</c><00:04:52.320><c> actually</c><00:04:52.639><c> maybe</c><00:04:52.880><c> do</c><00:04:53.000><c> it</c><00:04:53.160><c> this</c><00:04:53.320><c> way</c> said let's actually maybe do it this way said let's actually maybe do it this way I'll<00:04:54.440><c> create</c><00:04:54.639><c> a</c><00:04:54.720><c> marketing</c><00:04:55.080><c>
