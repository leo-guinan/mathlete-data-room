whereas it could be that<00:21:33.240><c> I</c><00:21:33.360><c> also</c><00:21:33.640><c> think</c><00:21:33.799><c> it'd</c><00:21:34.000><c> be</c><00:21:34.240><c> helpful</c><00:21:35.240><c> um</c><00:21:35.799><c> or</c> that I also think it'd be helpful um or that I also think it'd be helpful um or or<00:21:36.080><c> maybe</c><00:21:36.360><c> it's</c><00:21:36.559><c> all</c><00:21:36.760><c> because</c><00:21:37.000><c> they're</c><00:21:37.159><c> the</c> or maybe it's all because they're the or maybe it's all because they're the same<00:21:37.480><c>

okay well this is going to be okay well this is going to be about<00:21:46.440><c> travel</c><00:21:47.159><c> this</c><00:21:47.320><c> one</c><00:21:47.640><c> I'm</c><00:21:47.760><c> thinking</c><00:21:48.000><c> of</c> about travel this one I'm thinking of about travel this one I'm thinking of writing<00:21:48.320><c> a</c><00:21:48.440><c> book</c><00:21:48.720><c> this</c><00:21:48.840><c> one</c><00:21:49.320><c> I'm</c><00:21:49.440><c> thinking</c><00:21:49.600><c> of</c> writing a book this one I'm thinking of writing a book this one I'm thinking of starting<00:21:49.919><c> new</c><00:21:50.039><c> business</c><00:21:50.320><c> whatever</c><00:21:50.600><c> it</c><00:21:50.720><c> is</c> starting new business whatever it is starting new business whatever it is because<00:21:51.039><c> then</c><00:21:51.159><c> you</c><00:21:51.240><c> can</c><00:21:51.400><c> have</c><00:21:51.679><c> kind</c><00:21:51.799><c> of</c> because then you can have kind of because then you can have kind of separation<00:21:52.559><c> of</c><00:21:52.840><c> ideas</c><00:21:53.840><c> um</c><00:21:54.080><c> each</c><00:21:54.240><c> of</c><00:21:54.440><c> these</c> separation of ideas um each of these separation of ideas um each of these also<00:21:54.840><c> works</c><00:21:55.080><c> as</c><00:21:55.240><c> individual</c><00:21:55.600><c> sub</c><00:21:55.760><c> minines</c><00:21:56.000><c> as</c> also works as individual sub minines as also works as individual sub minines as well<00:21:56.240><c> which</c><00:21:56.400><c> I</c><00:21:56.480><c> think</c><00:21:56.600><c> is</c><00:21:56.720><c> really</c><00:21:56.919><c> good</c><00:21:57.400><c> the</c> well which I think is really good the well which I think is really good the one<00:21:57.640><c> thing</c><00:21:57.760><c> I</c><00:21:57.880><c> will</c><00:21:58.000><c> say</c><00:21:58.200><c> is</c><00:21:58.360><c> well</c> one thing I will say is well

the</c><00:23:01.279><c> thoughts</c> had a function to organize the thoughts had a function to organize the thoughts as<00:23:02.480><c> our</c><00:23:02.880><c> thoughts</c><00:23:03.360><c> work</c><00:23:04.080><c> cuz</c><00:23:04.279><c> the</c><00:23:04.400><c> whole</c><00:23:04.559><c> point</c> as our thoughts work cuz the whole point as our thoughts work cuz the whole point

it'd</c><00:23:11.440><c> be</c><00:23:11.559><c> nice</c> co-founder effectively so it'd be nice co-founder effectively so it'd be nice if<00:23:11.919><c> we</c><00:23:12.039><c>
