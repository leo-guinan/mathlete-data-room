heard</c><00:00:47.199><c> of</c><00:00:47.320><c> abundance</c><00:00:47.800><c> in</c> so perhaps you've heard of abundance in so perhaps you've heard of abundance in terms<00:00:48.199><c> of</c><00:00:48.360><c> like</c><00:00:48.480><c> an</c><00:00:48.640><c> abundance</c><00:00:49.199><c> mindset</c> terms of like an abundance mindset terms of like an abundance mindset

think</c><00:01:07.280><c> the</c><00:01:07.400><c> biggest</c> mindset to have but I think the biggest mindset to have but I think the biggest problem<00:01:08.200><c> here</c><00:01:09.000><c> is</c><00:01:09.320><c> that</c><00:01:10.080><c> we're</c><00:01:10.360><c> putting</c><00:01:10.759><c> too</c> problem here is that we're putting too problem here is that we're putting too much<00:01:11.400><c> pressure</c><00:01:11.799><c> on</c><00:01:12.159><c> individuals</c><00:01:13.080><c> to</c><00:01:13.360><c> change</c> much pressure on individuals to change much pressure on

thinking</c><00:01:18.520><c> is</c><00:01:18.680><c> a</c> reality is people's way of thinking is a reality is people's way of thinking is a direct<00:01:19.439><c> response</c><00:01:19.960><c> to</c><00:01:20.200><c> the</c><00:01:20.360><c> environment</c><00:01:21.000><c> that</c> direct response to the environment that direct response to the environment that they're<00:01:21.360><c> in</c><00:01:22.360><c> and</c><00:01:22.560><c> so</c><00:01:23.400><c> because</c><00:01:23.720><c> we've</c><00:01:23.960><c> got</c><00:01:24.280><c> all</c> they're in and so because we've got all they're in and so because we've got all of<00:01:25.119><c> these</c><00:01:26.159><c> scarce</c><00:01:27.159><c> systems</c><00:01:27.799><c> in</c><00:01:28.119><c> place</c><00:01:29.119><c> people</c> of these scarce systems in place people of these scarce systems in place people think<00:01:30.159><c> with</c><00:01:30.240><c> a</c><00:01:30.400><c> scarcity</c><00:01:31.240><c> mindset</c><00:01:32.240><c> so</c><00:01:32.399><c> let's</c> think with a scarcity mindset so let's think with a scarcity mindset so let's take<00:01:32.720><c> a</c><00:01:32.840><c>

you've<00:04:15.760><c> got</c><00:04:15.959><c> these</c><00:04:16.199><c> creators</c><00:04:16.759><c> that</c><00:04:16.919><c> start</c><00:04:17.160><c> to</c> you've got these creators that

um</c><00:04:22.520><c> and</c><00:04:22.759><c> so</c><00:04:23.320><c> they</c><00:04:23.440><c> kind</c> economy around them um and so they kind economy around them um and so they kind of<00:04:23.759><c> start</c><00:04:23.919><c> off</c><00:04:24.080><c> doing</c><00:04:24.440><c> everything</c><00:04:25.080><c> and</c><00:04:25.199><c> then</c> of start off doing everything and then of start off doing everything and then as<00:04:25.840><c> they</c><00:04:26.199><c> can</c><00:04:26.560><c> they</c><00:04:26.680><c> start</c><00:04:26.960><c> Outsourcing</c><00:04:27.600><c> bits</c> as they can they start Outsourcing bits as they can they start Outsourcing bits and<00:04:28.040><c> pieces</c><00:04:29.039><c> and</c><00:04:29.199><c> eventually</c><00:04:30.080><c> they've</c><00:04:30.320><c> got</c> and pieces and eventually they've got and pieces and eventually they've got this<00:04:30.800><c> whole</c><00:04:31.639><c> big</c><00:04:32.000><c> ecosystem</c><00:04:32.880><c> that</c><00:04:33.000><c> is</c><00:04:33.240><c> kind</c><00:04:33.400><c> of</c> this whole big ecosystem that is kind of this whole big ecosystem that is kind of

time and that's<00:04:36.240><c> actually</c><00:04:36.520><c> one</c><00:04:36.680><c> of</c><00:04:36.840><c> the</c><00:04:37.039><c> really</c> that's actually one of the really that's actually one of the really interesting<00:04:37.960><c> things</c><00:04:38.280><c> about</c><00:04:38.560><c> abundant</c> interesting things about abundant interesting things about abundant

systems<00:04:43.080><c> evolve</c><00:04:43.520><c> over</c><00:04:43.800><c> time</c><00:04:44.120><c> and</c><00:04:44.280><c> become</c><00:04:44.680><c> more</c> systems evolve over time and become more systems evolve over time and become more efficient<00:04:46.280><c> so</c><00:04:46.680><c> in</c><00:04:46.800><c> the</c><00:04:46.960><c> beginning</c><00:04:47.560><c> you've</c><00:04:47.759><c> got</c> efficient so in the beginning you've got efficient so in the beginning you've got a<00:04:48.039><c> Creator</c><00:04:48.560><c> who's</c><00:04:48.800><c> doing</c><00:04:49.160><c> everything</c><00:04:49.680><c> they</c> a Creator who's doing everything they a Creator who's doing everything they may<00:04:49.960><c> not</c><00:04:50.120><c> be</c><00:04:50.280><c> good</c><00:04:50.440><c> at</c><00:04:50.639><c> everything</c><00:04:51.160><c> but</c><00:04:51.320><c> they</c> may not be good at everything but they may not be good at everything but they do<00:04:51.759><c> everything</c><00:04:52.240><c> because</c><00:04:52.479><c> they</c><00:04:52.639><c> don't</c><00:04:52.880><c> have</c> do everything because they don't have do everything because they don't have the<00:04:53.280><c> resources</c><00:04:54.280><c> to</c><00:04:54.479><c> Outsource</c> the resources to Outsource the resources to Outsource typically<00:04:57.000><c> um</c><00:04:58.000><c> and</c><00:04:58.400><c> so</c><00:04:59.400><c> over</c><00:04:59.720><c> over</c><00:04:59.919><c> time</c><00:05:00.199><c> they</c> typically um and so over over time they typically um and so over over time they start<00:05:00.880><c> gaining</c><00:05:01.360><c> resources</c><00:05:01.919><c> and</c><00:05:02.080><c> they</c><00:05:02.199><c> start</c> start gaining resources and they start start gaining resources and they start feeding<00:05:02.759><c> that</c><00:05:02.960><c> back</c><00:05:03.120><c> into</c><00:05:03.360><c> the</c><00:05:03.560><c> ecosystem</c><00:05:04.440><c> and</c> feeding that back into the ecosystem and feeding that back into the ecosystem and so<00:05:04.720><c> the</c><00:05:04.880><c> ecosystem</c><00:05:05.600><c> becomes</c><00:05:06.000><c> more</c><00:05:06.280><c> efficient</c> so the ecosystem becomes more efficient so the ecosystem becomes more efficient it<00:05:06.759><c> becomes</c><00:05:07.080><c> more</c> it becomes more it becomes more specialized<00:05:09.000><c> um</c><00:05:09.639><c> and</c><00:05:09.759><c> you</c><00:05:09.880><c> bring</c><00:05:10.120><c> in</c><00:05:10.440><c> these</c> specialized um and you bring in these specialized um and you bring in these different<00:05:11.919><c> uh</c><00:05:12.680><c> basically</c><00:05:13.120><c> symbiotic</c> different uh basically symbiotic different uh basically symbiotic participants<00:05:14.639><c> into</c><00:05:15.120><c> this</c><00:05:15.919><c> system</c><00:05:16.280><c> that's</c>

look</c><00:05:18.639><c> at</c><00:05:18.800><c> the</c> getting created now let's look at the getting created now let's look at the other<00:05:19.199><c> extreme</c><00:05:20.120><c> and</c><00:05:20.319><c> we'll</c><00:05:20.520><c> say</c><00:05:21.080><c> government</c> other extreme and we'll say government other extreme and we'll say government so<00:05:22.520><c> government</c><00:05:23.520><c> is</c><00:05:23.840><c> the</c><00:05:24.000><c> ultimate</c><00:05:24.440><c> scare</c> so government is the ultimate scare so government is the ultimate scare
