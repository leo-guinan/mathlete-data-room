and that honestly felt really weird<00:00:56.600><c> to</c><00:00:56.719><c> me</c><00:00:57.120><c> because</c><00:00:57.520><c> one</c><00:00:57.640><c> of</c><00:00:57.760><c> the</c><00:00:57.879><c> things</c> weird to me because one of the things weird to me because one of the things that<00:00:58.199><c> I</c><00:00:58.320><c> noticed</c><00:00:58.800><c> when</c><00:00:58.960><c> I</c><00:00:59.079><c> switched</c><00:00:59.440><c> over</c><00:00:59.640><c> to</c> that I noticed when I switched over to that I noticed when I switched over to it<00:01:00.120><c> is</c><00:01:00.280><c> something</c><00:01:00.640><c> that</c><00:01:00.800><c> I</c><00:01:01.039><c> was</c><00:01:02.039><c> using</c><00:01:02.399><c> to</c> it is something that I was using to it is something that I was using to generate<00:01:03.079><c> code</c><00:01:03.680><c> that</c><00:01:04.360><c> wasn't</c><00:01:04.760><c> working</c><00:01:05.080><c> for</c><00:01:05.280><c> me</c> generate code that wasn't working for me generate code that wasn't working for me automatically<00:01:07.360><c> started</c><00:01:07.799><c> working</c><00:01:08.439><c> when</c><00:01:08.600><c> I</c> automatically started working when I automatically started working when I switched<00:01:09.040><c> over</c><00:01:09.360><c> to</c><00:01:09.560><c> GPT</c> switched over to GPT switched over to GPT 40<00:01:11.720><c> and</c><00:01:12.000><c> so</c><00:01:12.840><c> I</c><00:01:12.920><c> was</c><00:01:13.200><c> like</c><00:01:13.840><c> huh</c><00:01:14.320><c> that's</c><00:01:14.560><c> really</c> 40 and so I was like huh that's really 40 and so I was like huh that's really weird<00:01:15.560><c> and</c><00:01:15.640><c> then</c><00:01:15.759><c> I</c><00:01:15.960><c> started</c><00:01:16.119><c> to</c><00:01:16.200><c> see</c><00:01:16.400><c> other</c> weird and then I started to see other weird and then I started to see other people<00:01:16.799><c> saying</c><00:01:17.159><c> like</c><00:01:17.360><c> oh</c><00:01:17.520><c> no</c><00:01:17.799><c> actually</c><00:01:18.360><c> GPT</c><00:01:18.880><c> 40</c> people saying like oh no actually GPT 40 people saying like oh no actually GPT 40 is<00:01:19.520><c> great</c><00:01:19.720><c> at</c><00:01:19.840><c> writing</c> is great at writing is great at writing code<00:01:22.240><c> and</c><00:01:23.240><c> so</c><00:01:23.720><c> to</c><00:01:24.439><c> me</c><00:01:25.439><c> I</c><00:01:25.640><c> I</c><00:01:25.680><c> don't</c><00:01:25.840><c> have</c><00:01:26.000><c> any</c> code and so to me I I don't have any code and so to me I I don't have any answers<00:01:26.600><c> as</c><00:01:26.720><c> to</c><00:01:26.920><c> why</c><00:01:27.079><c> this</c><00:01:27.280><c> is</c><00:01:27.840><c> but</c><00:01:28.119><c> I've</c><00:01:28.280><c> got</c><00:01:28.400><c> a</c> answers as to why this is but I've got a answers as to why this is but I've got a couple<00:01:28.759><c> theories</c><00:01:30.200><c> and</c><00:01:30.439><c> most</c><00:01:30.680><c> of</c><00:01:30.799><c> it</c><00:01:30.960><c> comes</c> couple theories and most of it comes couple theories and most of it comes down<00:01:31.799><c> to</c><00:01:33.079><c> prompting</c><00:01:34.079><c> and</c><00:01:34.640><c> how</c><00:01:34.920><c> well</c> down to prompting and how well down to prompting and how well people people people actually<00:01:38.840><c> say</c><00:01:39.560><c> what</c><00:01:39.920><c> exactly</c><00:01:40.720><c> they</c><00:01:40.880><c> want</c><00:01:41.200><c> to</c> actually say what exactly they want to actually say what exactly they want to generate<00:01:42.840><c> and</c><00:01:43.560><c> so</c><00:01:44.560><c> typically</c><00:01:45.079><c> when</c><00:01:45.280><c> I'm</c> generate and so typically when I'm generate and so typically when I'm generating<00:01:46.439><c> code</c><00:01:47.439><c> with</c><00:01:48.000><c> some</c><00:01:48.200><c> sort</c><00:01:48.399><c> of</c><00:01:48.719><c> large</c> generating code with some sort of large generating code with some sort of large language<00:01:49.880><c> model</c><00:01:51.040><c> I'm</c><00:01:52.040><c> telling</c><00:01:52.439><c> it</c><00:01:53.159><c> as</c> language model I'm telling it as language model I'm telling it as specifically<00:01:54.280><c> as</c><00:01:54.399><c> I</c><00:01:54.680><c> can</c><00:01:55.680><c> what</c><00:01:55.799><c> I</c><00:01:55.920><c> want</c><00:01:56.079><c> it</c><00:01:56.200><c> to</c> specifically as I can what I want it to specifically as I can what I want it to do<00:01:57.680><c> I</c><00:01:57.960><c> have</c><00:01:58.320><c> a</c><00:01:58.520><c> very</c><00:01:58.799><c> clear</c><00:01:59.159><c> Vision</c><00:01:59.439><c> in</c><00:01:59.560><c> my</c><00:01:59.680><c> head</c> do I have a very clear Vision in my head do I have a very clear Vision in my head as<00:02:00.799><c> to</c><00:02:01.000><c> what</c><00:02:01.119><c> I</c><00:02:01.439><c> want</c><00:02:02.439><c> and</c><00:02:02.799><c> I</c><00:02:02.960><c> don't</c><00:02:03.360><c> want</c><00:02:03.600><c> it</c><00:02:03.920><c> to</c> as to what I want and I don't want it to as to what I want and I don't want it to necessarily<00:02:05.439><c> have</c><00:02:05.600><c> a</c><00:02:05.719><c> lot</c><00:02:05.840><c> of</c><00:02:06.000><c> variation</c><00:02:06.840><c> in</c> necessarily have a lot of variation in necessarily have a lot of variation in what<00:02:07.119><c> it</c> what it what it generates<00:02:08.959><c> and</c><00:02:09.399><c> so</c><00:02:10.399><c> this</c><00:02:10.599><c> is</c><00:02:10.840><c> kind</c><00:02:10.959><c> of</c><00:02:11.120><c> the</c> generates and so this is kind of the generates and so this is kind of the structure<00:02:11.800><c> that</c><00:02:11.920><c> I</c><00:02:12.080><c> had</c><00:02:12.280><c> set</c><00:02:12.520><c> up</c><00:02:13.120><c> that</c><00:02:13.360><c> says</c> structure that I had set up that says structure that I had set up that says okay<00:02:14.519><c> this</c> okay this okay this is<00:02:16.519><c> um</c><00:02:17.400><c> what</c><00:02:17.560><c> I</c><00:02:17.680><c> want</c><00:02:18.319><c> now</c><00:02:18.560><c> generate</c><00:02:19.000><c> it</c><00:02:19.560><c> and</c><00:02:19.720><c> I</c> is um what I want now generate it and I is um what I want now generate it and I think<00:02:20.160><c> GPT</c><00:02:20.680><c> 40</c><00:02:21.519><c> did</c><00:02:21.720><c> a</c><00:02:21.920><c> better</c><00:02:22.239><c> job</c><00:02:22.440><c> of</c><00:02:22.599><c> giving</c> think GPT 40 did a better job of giving think GPT 40 did a better job of giving me<00:02:23.319><c> exactly</c><00:02:23.959><c> what</c><00:02:24.120><c> I</c><00:02:24.319><c> asked</c><00:02:24.640><c> for</c><00:02:25.480><c> when</c><00:02:25.640><c> I</c><00:02:25.800><c> asked</c> me exactly what I asked for when I asked me exactly what I asked for when I asked for<00:02:26.200><c> it</c><00:02:27.080><c> so</c><00:02:27.280><c> then</c><00:02:27.400><c> the</c><00:02:27.519><c> Counterpoint</c><00:02:28.040><c> of</c><00:02:28.200><c> that</c> for it so then the Counterpoint of that for it so then the Counterpoint of that is<00:02:29.200><c> if</c><00:02:29.920><c> it's</c><00:02:30.120><c> giving</c><00:02:30.360><c> me</c><00:02:30.519><c> exactly</c><00:02:30.840><c> what</c><00:02:30.959><c> I</c><00:02:31.040><c> want</c> is if it's giving me exactly what I want is if it's giving me exactly what I want when<00:02:31.319><c> I</c><00:02:31.440><c> ask</c><00:02:31.640><c> for</c><00:02:31.800><c> it</c><00:02:32.319><c> and</c><00:02:32.480><c> other</c><00:02:32.640><c> people</c><00:02:32.800><c> are</c> when I ask for it and other people are when I ask for it and other people are complaining<00:02:34.040><c> I</c><00:02:34.200><c> think</c><00:02:34.840><c> those</c><00:02:35.239><c> people</c><00:02:36.239><c> maybe</c> complaining I think those people maybe complaining I think those people maybe aren't<00:02:38.000><c> saying</c><00:02:38.519><c> exactly</c><00:02:39.000><c> what</c><00:02:39.159><c> they</c><00:02:39.319><c> want</c> aren't saying exactly what they

room</c><00:02:41.360><c> for</c> maybe they're leaving a lot of room for maybe they're leaving a lot of room for interpretation<00:02:43.239><c> and</c><00:02:43.800><c> there's</c><00:02:44.040><c> a</c><00:02:44.239><c> lot</c><00:02:44.519><c> more</c> interpretation and there's a lot more interpretation and there's a lot more kind<00:02:45.440><c> of</c><00:02:45.720><c> white</c><00:02:46.120><c> space</c><00:02:46.720><c> around</c><00:02:47.680><c> what</c><00:02:47.840><c> it</c><00:02:47.920><c> is</c> kind of white space around what it is kind of white space around what it is they're<00:02:48.319><c> looking</c><00:02:48.599><c> for</c><00:02:49.440><c> and</c><00:02:50.040><c> so</c><00:02:51.040><c> they're</c><00:02:51.360><c> not</c> they're looking
