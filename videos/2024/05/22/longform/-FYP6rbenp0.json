the</c><00:04:02.840><c> first</c><00:04:03.040><c> and</c><00:04:03.200><c> foremost</c><00:04:03.760><c> if</c><00:04:03.879><c> you</c><00:04:04.079><c> don't</c> of the first and foremost if you don't of the first and foremost if you don't offer<00:04:05.680><c> an</c><00:04:05.879><c> abundant</c><00:04:06.640><c> system</c><00:04:07.640><c> people</c><00:04:08.159><c> will</c> offer an

guess</c><00:04:10.519><c> who's</c> find the Abundant system and guess who's find the Abundant system and guess who's going<00:04:10.920><c> to</c><00:04:11.040><c> be</c><00:04:11.200><c> the</c><00:04:11.319><c> first</c><00:04:11.560><c> one</c><00:04:11.920><c> to</c><00:04:12.079><c> leave</c><00:04:12.439><c> to</c> going to be the first one to leave to going to be the first one to leave to find<00:04:12.840><c> that</c><00:04:12.959><c> abundant</c><00:04:13.439><c> system</c><00:04:14.200><c> your</c><00:04:14.439><c> top</c> find that abundant system your top find that abundant system your top performers<00:04:16.199><c> so</c><00:04:16.680><c> if</c><00:04:16.799><c> you</c><00:04:17.000><c> really</c><00:04:17.199><c> want</c><00:04:17.320><c> to</c><00:04:17.560><c> keep</c> performers so if you really want to keep performers so if you really want to keep your<00:04:18.160><c> best</c><00:04:18.440><c> talent</c><00:04:18.840><c> around</c><00:04:19.639><c> you've</c><00:04:19.959><c> got</c><00:04:20.079><c> to</c> your best talent around you've got to your best talent around you've got to give<00:04:20.639><c> them</c><00:04:20.959><c> a</c><00:04:21.199><c> place</c><00:04:21.479><c> to</c><00:04:21.680><c> grow</c><00:04:22.320><c> into</c><00:04:23.320><c> and</c><00:04:23.400><c> so</c><00:04:23.560><c> I</c> give them a place to grow into and so I give them a place to grow into and so I think<00:04:23.960><c> that's</c><00:04:24.199><c> first</c><00:04:24.440><c> and</c><00:04:24.600><c> foremost</c><00:04:25.199><c> maybe</c> think that's first and foremost maybe think that's first and foremost maybe how<00:04:25.680><c> I</c><00:04:25.800><c> can</c><00:04:25.960><c> communicate</c><00:04:26.919><c> this</c><00:04:27.919><c> um</c><00:04:28.600><c> and</c><00:04:28.800><c> then</c> how I can communicate this um and then how I can communicate this um and then
