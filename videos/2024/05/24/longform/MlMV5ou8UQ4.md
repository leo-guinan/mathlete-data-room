thinking about everything that<00:01:21.479><c> I'm</c><00:01:21.680><c> doing</c><00:01:22.640><c> and</c><00:01:23.640><c> where</c><00:01:23.960><c> it</c><00:01:24.159><c> all</c><00:01:24.439><c> comes</c> that I'm doing and where it all comes that I'm doing and where it all comes together<00:01:25.119><c> and</c><00:01:25.280><c> I</c><00:01:25.479><c> I</c><00:01:25.640><c> I</c><00:01:25.799><c> I've</c><00:01:25.960><c> got</c><00:01:26.159><c> a</c><00:01:27.159><c> book</c><00:01:27.360><c> in</c> together and I I I I've got a book in together and I I I I've got a book in progress<00:01:28.159><c> on</c><00:01:28.320><c> the</c><00:01:28.560><c> topic</c><00:01:29.200><c> so</c><00:01:29.479><c> I</c><00:01:29.560><c> think</c><00:01:29.759><c> that</c> progress on the topic so I think that progress on the topic so I think that that's<00:01:30.040><c> a</c><00:01:30.119><c> good</c><00:01:30.320><c> place</c><00:01:30.479><c> to</c><00:01:30.640><c> start</c><00:01:31.400><c> and</c><00:01:31.560><c> that's</c> that's a good place to start and that's that's a good place to start and that's the<00:01:31.840><c> concept</c><00:01:32.159><c> of</c><00:01:32.320><c> abundant</c><00:01:33.200><c> systems</c><00:01:34.320><c> so</c> the concept of abundant systems so the concept of abundant systems so abundance<00:01:35.920><c> here</c><00:01:36.520><c> can</c><00:01:36.640><c> mean</c><00:01:36.920><c> like</c><00:01:37.040><c> a</c><00:01:37.119><c> lot</c><00:01:37.240><c> of</c> abundance here can mean like a lot of abundance here can mean like a lot of different<00:01:37.600><c> things</c><00:01:38.159><c> but</c><00:01:38.600><c> ultimately</c><00:01:39.280><c> an</c> different things but ultimately an different things but ultimately an abundant<00:01:40.000><c> system</c><00:01:40.880><c> is</c><00:01:41.399><c> like</c><00:01:41.720><c> a</c><00:01:41.920><c> system</c><00:01:42.439><c> with</c><00:01:42.799><c> a</c> abundant system is like a system with a abundant system is like a system with a group<00:01:43.119><c> of</c><00:01:43.280><c> people</c><00:01:43.560><c> working</c><00:01:43.880><c> toward</c><00:01:44.079><c> a</c><00:01:44.159><c> shared</c> group of people working toward a shared group of people working toward a shared goal<00:01:45.520><c> in</c><00:01:45.719><c> which</c><00:01:46.360><c> like</c><00:01:47.280><c> every</c><00:01:47.600><c> person</c> goal in which like every person goal in which like every person individually<00:01:48.920><c> can</c><00:01:49.560><c> basically</c><00:01:50.159><c> maximize</c> individually can basically maximize individually can basically maximize their<00:01:50.920><c> own</c><00:01:51.200><c> benefit</c><00:01:52.159><c> and</c><00:01:52.360><c> that</c><00:01:52.640><c> maximizes</c><00:01:53.399><c> the</c> their own benefit and that maximizes the their own benefit and that maximizes the benefit<00:01:54.119><c> to</c><00:01:54.479><c> everybody</c><00:01:54.920><c> in</c><00:01:55.079><c> the</c><00:01:55.600><c> system</c> benefit to everybody in the system benefit to everybody in the system without<00:01:57.159><c> taking</c><00:01:57.479><c> away</c><00:01:57.719><c> from</c><00:01:57.920><c> people</c><00:01:58.320><c> right</c><00:01:58.479><c> so</c> without taking away from people right so without taking away from people right so if<00:01:58.719><c> you've</c><00:01:58.920><c> got</c><00:01:59.079><c> like</c><00:01:59.200><c> a</c><00:01:59.320><c> scarce</c><00:02:00.079><c> system</c><00:02:01.079><c> if</c> if you've got like a scarce system if if you've got like a scarce system if

that's<00:03:38.480><c> the</c><00:03:38.680><c> problem</c><00:03:38.920><c> with</c><00:03:39.239><c> having</c><00:03:39.920><c> a</c><00:03:40.239><c> a</c> that's the problem with having a a that's the problem with having a a scarce<00:03:40.840><c> system</c><00:03:41.120><c> so</c><00:03:41.280><c> a</c><00:03:41.400><c> scarce</c><00:03:42.000><c> system</c><00:03:43.000><c>

most people maybe all people way I think most people maybe all people feel<00:15:09.160><c> about</c><00:15:09.560><c> future</c><00:15:10.279><c> just</c><00:15:10.519><c>

that's</c><00:17:07.000><c> a</c><00:17:07.199><c> big</c><00:17:07.520><c> thing</c> cliffs so that's that that's a big thing cliffs so that's that that's a big thing for<00:17:07.919><c>

you</c><00:17:18.520><c> couldn't</c><00:17:18.839><c> fix</c><00:17:19.600><c> so</c><00:17:20.480><c> I</c> something that you couldn't fix so I something that you couldn't fix so I actually<00:17:20.959><c> think</c> actually think actually think we<00:17:23.439><c> maybe</c><00:17:23.839><c> there</c><00:17:24.240><c> was</c><00:17:24.880><c> at</c><00:17:25.000><c> a</c><00:17:25.319><c> certain</c><00:17:25.799><c> point</c><00:17:26.039><c> of</c> we maybe there was at a certain point of we maybe there was at a certain point of view view view

maybe</c><00:22:19.720><c> some</c> charge more as well and maybe some charge more as well and maybe some people<00:22:20.159><c> will</c><00:22:20.360><c> fall</c><00:22:20.640><c> off</c><00:22:20.799><c> and</c><00:22:20.919><c> I</c><00:22:21.039><c> will</c><00:22:21.159><c> need</c><00:22:21.320><c> to</c> people will fall off and I will need to people will fall off and I will need to move<00:22:21.640><c> to</c><00:22:21.760><c> a</c><00:22:21.840><c> slightly</c><00:22:22.159><c> different</c><00:22:22.400><c> market</c><00:22:22.760><c> and</c> move to a slightly

but</c><00:22:23.799><c> it's</c><00:22:24.000><c> no</c><00:22:24.960><c> Asaka</c> so on and so forth but it's no Asaka so on and so forth but it's no Asaka potatoes<00:22:26.279><c> still</c><00:22:27.120><c> provides</c><00:22:27.720><c> the</c><00:22:27.880><c> same</c><00:22:28.240><c> value</c> potatoes still provides the same value potatoes still provides the same value value<00:22:30.279><c> and</c><00:22:30.480><c> therefore</c><00:22:31.159><c> conceptually</c><00:22:31.760><c> it</c> value and therefore conceptually it value and therefore conceptually it costs<00:22:32.240><c> the</c><00:22:32.400><c> same</c><00:22:32.760><c> but</c><00:22:32.919><c> the</c><00:22:33.080><c> dollar</c><00:22:33.400><c> has</c><00:22:33.600><c> lost</c> costs the same but the dollar has lost costs the same but the dollar has lost its<00:22:34.080><c> value</c><00:22:34.320><c> so</c><00:22:34.480><c> I</c><00:22:34.600><c> just</c><00:22:34.760><c>

so prices are simply highly compressed so prices are simply highly compressed information<00:23:27.960><c> right</c><00:23:28.880><c> it's</c><00:23:29.120><c> basically</c><00:23:29.720><c>

you</c> if you don't spend that 100,000 and you if you don't spend that 100,000 and you still<00:24:24.440><c> accomplish</c><00:24:24.840><c> your</c><00:24:25.000><c> goals</c><00:24:25.799><c> what</c><00:24:25.960><c> happens</c> still accomplish your goals what happens still accomplish your goals what happens the<00:24:26.440><c> following</c><00:24:26.840><c> year</c><00:24:27.640><c> they</c><00:24:27.799><c> cut</c><00:24:27.960><c> your</c><00:24:28.080><c> budget</c> the following year they cut your budget the following year they cut your budget and<00:24:29.080><c> so</c><00:24:29.279><c> the</c><00:24:29.440><c> incentive</c><00:24:29.799><c> is</c><00:24:29.919><c> to</c><00:24:30.120><c> spend</c><00:24:30.360><c> your</c> and so the incentive is to spend your and so the incentive is to spend your budget<00:24:31.039><c> on</c><00:24:32.000><c> whatever</c><00:24:33.000><c> because</c><00:24:33.679><c> otherwise</c> budget on whatever because otherwise budget on whatever because otherwise like<00:24:34.720><c> you're</c><00:24:34.960><c> going</c><00:24:35.200><c> to</c><00:24:35.840><c> have</c><00:24:36.159><c> less</c><00:24:36.440><c> of</c><00:24:36.520><c> a</c> like you're going to have less of a like you're going to have less of a budget<00:24:36.960><c> to</c><00:24:37.120><c> work</c><00:24:37.360><c> with</c><00:24:37.720><c> and</c><00:24:37.799><c> then</c><00:24:37.960><c> you</c><00:24:38.080><c> have</c> budget to work with and then you have budget to work with and then you have less<00:24:38.880><c> optionality</c><00:24:39.880><c> and</c><00:24:40.039><c> so</c><00:24:40.520><c> there</c><00:24:40.840><c> a</c><00:24:40.960><c> weird</c> less optionality and so there a

thing</c> incentive isn't it and that's the thing incentive isn't it and that's the thing like<00:24:43.279><c> the</c><00:24:43.399><c> economy</c><00:24:43.799><c> is</c><00:24:43.919><c>

when</c><00:24:46.080><c> you</c><00:24:46.360><c> actually</c><00:24:47.000><c> allow</c><00:24:47.440><c> things</c> whereas when you actually allow things whereas when you actually allow things

that</c> create these really cool systems that create these really cool systems that basically<00:24:54.640><c> allow</c><00:24:55.640><c> prices</c><00:24:56.559><c> to</c><00:24:57.559><c> in</c><00:24:57.679><c> the</c><00:24:57.760><c> end</c> basically allow prices to in the end basically allow prices to in the end price<00:24:58.760><c> become</c><00:24:59.480><c> steadier</c><00:25:00.080><c> because</c><00:25:00.320><c> what</c><00:25:00.399><c> you</c> price become steadier because what you price become steadier because what you do<00:25:00.720><c> is</c><00:25:00.840><c> you</c><00:25:01.039><c> actually</c><00:25:01.240><c> want</c><00:25:01.360><c> to</c><00:25:01.840><c> maximize</c><00:25:02.520><c> for</c> do is you actually want to

like</c><00:47:18.960><c> multiple</c> do this and then you have like multiple do this and then you have like multiple companies<00:47:19.960><c> doing</c><00:47:20.319><c> that</c><00:47:20.520><c> same</c><00:47:20.880><c> thing</c><00:47:21.200><c> how</c><00:47:21.319><c> does</c> companies doing that same thing how does companies doing that same thing how does that<00:47:21.680><c> impact</c><00:47:22.040><c> the</c><00:47:22.200><c> client</c><00:47:23.200><c> and</c><00:47:23.319><c> so</c><00:47:23.480><c> you</c><00:47:23.599><c> can</c> that impact the client and so you can that impact the client and so you can look<00:47:23.960><c> at</c><00:47:24.160><c> that</c><00:47:24.400><c> and</c><00:47:24.559><c> say</c><00:47:24.920><c> oh</c><00:47:25.319><c> actually</c><00:47:26.319><c> that</c> look at that and say oh actually that look at that and say oh actually that means means means again<00:47:27.800><c> the</c><00:47:28.200><c> the</c><00:47:28.359><c> cold</c><00:47:28.920><c> Outreach</c><00:47:29.920><c> uh</c><00:47:30.319><c> example</c> again the the cold Outreach uh example again the the cold Outreach uh example that<00:47:30.800><c> we</c><00:47:30.960><c> talked</c><00:47:31.160><c> about</c><00:47:31.400><c> earlier</c><00:47:31.880><c> right</c><00:47:32.040><c> it's</c> that we talked about earlier right it's that we talked about earlier right it's like<00:47:32.400><c> when</c><00:47:32.559><c> everybody</c><00:47:32.960><c> does</c><00:47:33.319><c> that</c><00:47:34.280><c> it</c> like when everybody does that it like when everybody does that it actually<00:47:34.880><c> makes</c><00:47:35.119><c> it</c><00:47:35.359><c> worse</c><00:47:35.640><c> for</c><00:47:35.880><c> everybody</c> actually makes it worse for everybody actually makes it worse for everybody because<00:47:37.000><c> it</c><00:47:37.200><c> just</c><00:47:37.520><c> adds</c><00:47:37.839><c> noise</c><00:47:38.200><c> to</c><00:47:38.400><c> the</c><00:47:38.599><c> system</c> because it just adds noise to the system because it just adds noise to the system that<00:47:39.960><c> doesn't</c><00:47:40.240><c> need</c><00:47:40.440><c> to</c><00:47:40.599><c> be</c><00:47:40.880><c> there</c><00:47:41.839><c> and</c><00:47:42.240><c> that's</c> that doesn't need to be there and that's that doesn't need to be there and that's likely<00:47:42.880><c> a</c><00:47:43.040><c> harder</c><00:47:43.400><c> sell</c><00:47:43.760><c> for</c><00:47:44.000><c> a</c><00:47:44.200><c>
