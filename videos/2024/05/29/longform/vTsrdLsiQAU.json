hey a new AI uh model now right oh great hey a new AI uh model was<00:08:08.680><c> released</c><00:08:09.319><c> and</c><00:08:09.440><c> so</c><00:08:09.720><c> now</c><00:08:09.879><c> there's</c><00:08:10.039><c> all</c> was released and so now there's all was released and so now there's all these<00:08:10.360><c> products</c><00:08:10.720><c> being</c><00:08:10.919><c>

now<00:08:12.400><c> you've</c><00:08:12.520><c> got</c><00:08:12.639><c> all</c><00:08:12.800><c> these</c><00:08:13.000><c> decisions</c><00:08:13.599><c> like</c> now you've got all these decisions like now you've got all these decisions like do<00:08:14.280><c> these</c><00:08:14.440><c> added</c><00:08:14.759><c> features</c><00:08:15.440><c> actually</c><00:08:15.879><c> make</c><00:08:16.080><c> my</c> do these added features actually make my do these added features actually make my business<00:08:16.560><c> run</c><00:08:16.800><c> more</c><00:08:17.039><c>
