because</c><00:03:48.200><c> everybody</c> actually makes sense because everybody actually makes sense because everybody needs<00:03:48.840><c> to</c><00:03:49.319><c> understand</c><00:03:49.519><c>

way<00:04:05.040><c> you</c><00:04:05.200><c> want</c><00:04:05.560><c> to</c><00:04:05.879><c> sacrifice</c><00:04:06.519><c> individual</c> way you want to sacrifice individual way you want to

think</c><00:04:13.879><c> it's</c><00:04:14.079><c> headed</c><00:04:14.640><c> is</c><00:04:14.799><c> we're</c> the way I think it's headed is we're the way I think it's headed is we're

individually</c><00:04:27.919><c> efficient</c><00:04:28.360><c> systems</c> translate individually efficient systems translate individually efficient systems into<00:04:29.759><c>

from there is a system in which I could like<00:04:47.479><c> jot</c><00:04:47.840><c> stuff</c><00:04:48.080><c> down</c><00:04:48.360><c> there</c><00:04:49.199><c> and</c><00:04:49.400><c> then</c><00:04:49.840><c> an</c><00:04:50.039><c> AI</c> like jot stuff down there and then an AI like jot stuff down there and then an AI process<00:04:50.759><c> would</c><00:04:50.960><c>

a</c><00:05:22.919><c> submind</c><00:05:23.400><c> one</c><00:05:23.560><c> might</c><00:05:23.880><c> say</c> process perhaps a submind one might say process perhaps a submind one might say

um</c><00:09:17.279><c> but</c><00:09:17.399><c> I've</c><00:09:17.560><c> just</c><00:09:17.680><c> moved</c><00:09:17.959><c> on</c><00:09:18.120><c> to</c> some point um but I've just moved on to

was</c><00:09:21.560><c> a</c><00:09:21.680><c> harder</c><00:09:21.959><c> sale</c> it turns out like that was a harder sale it turns out like that was a harder sale and<00:09:22.560><c> I</c><00:09:22.680><c> wanted</c><00:09:22.959><c> to</c><00:09:23.160><c> kind</c><00:09:23.360><c> of</c><00:09:24.519><c> um</c><00:09:25.519><c> get</c><00:09:25.800><c>

don't</c><00:09:40.839><c> think</c><00:09:41.000><c> there's</c> piece but yeah I don't think there's piece but yeah I don't think there's going<00:09:41.320><c> to</c><00:09:41.440><c> be</c><00:09:41.720><c> as</c><00:09:41.920><c> much</c><00:09:42.200><c> value</c><00:09:42.600><c> in</c><00:09:42.760><c> these</c> going to be as much value in these going to be as much value in these Enterprise<00:09:43.399><c> systems</c><00:09:43.839><c> because</c><00:09:44.000><c> there's</c><00:09:44.200><c> going</c> Enterprise systems because there's going Enterprise systems because

at</c><00:09:45.959><c> the</c><00:09:46.160><c> shift</c> to be bloat and if you look at the shift to be bloat and if you look at the shift from<00:09:47.360><c> kind</c><00:09:47.600><c> of</c><00:09:48.160><c> people</c><00:09:48.480><c> being</c><00:09:49.000><c> the</c><00:09:49.839><c> doers</c><00:09:50.480><c> to</c> from kind of people being the doers to from kind of people

the</c><00:09:59.079><c> the</c><00:09:59.399><c> most</c> everything so basically the the most everything so basically the the most valuable<00:09:59.920><c> skill</c><00:10:00.399><c>
