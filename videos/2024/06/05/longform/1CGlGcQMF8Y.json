so</c><00:06:26.960><c> we</c> to drive long-term value um and so we to drive long-term value um and so we really<00:06:27.319><c> need</c><00:06:27.479><c> to</c><00:06:27.680><c> think</c><00:06:27.919><c> about</c><00:06:28.400><c> systems</c><00:06:29.240><c> uh</c> really need to think about systems uh really need to think about systems uh for<00:06:29.560><c>

let's</c><00:06:36.599><c> assume</c> to exist long term let's let's assume to exist long term let's let's assume that<00:06:37.199><c> the</c><00:06:37.560><c> participants</c><00:06:38.120><c> in</c><00:06:38.280><c> the</c><00:06:38.680><c> in</c><00:06:38.800><c> the</c> that the participants in the in the that the participants in the in the system<00:06:39.720><c> are</c><00:06:39.880><c> going</c><00:06:40.039><c> to</c><00:06:40.160><c> be</c><00:06:40.319><c> around</c><00:06:40.639><c> long</c><00:06:40.919><c> term</c> system are going to be around long

the so how can we maximize the long-term<00:06:44.360><c> value</c><00:06:44.840><c> of</c><00:06:45.039><c> any</c><00:06:45.240><c> interactions</c><00:06:45.919><c> that</c> long-term value of any

I</c><00:06:49.599><c> think</c><00:06:50.599><c> by</c><00:06:50.840><c> focusing</c> we have and you know I think by focusing we have and you know I think by focusing on<00:06:52.680><c> not</c><00:06:52.919><c> the</c><00:06:53.080><c> audience</c><00:06:53.919><c> but</c><00:06:54.120><c> the</c><00:06:54.759><c> content</c><00:06:55.759><c> and</c> on not the audience but the

that's where we can ultimately<00:07:02.199><c> uh</c><00:07:02.680><c> you</c><00:07:02.800><c> know</c><00:07:02.960><c> be</c><00:07:03.199><c> very</c> ultimately uh you know be very ultimately uh you know be very successful<00:07:04.800><c> and</c> successful and successful and so<00:07:06.560><c> that's</c><00:07:06.759><c> why</c><00:07:06.919><c> I</c><00:07:07.039><c>

that's</c><00:07:08.919><c> why</c><00:07:09.080><c> I</c><00:07:09.240><c> don't</c><00:07:09.560><c> try</c><00:07:10.400><c> to</c><00:07:11.400><c> have</c><00:07:11.639><c> the</c> way that's why

look</c><00:07:13.280><c> at</c><00:07:13.440><c> the</c> flashy thumbnails and if you look at the flashy thumbnails and if you look at the earlier<00:07:14.479><c> videos</c><00:07:14.800><c>
