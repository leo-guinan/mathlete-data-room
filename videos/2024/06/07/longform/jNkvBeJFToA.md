company's</c><00:00:59.039><c> hiring</c> of funnel and so when a company's hiring of funnel and so when a company's hiring what<00:00:59.519><c> they're</c><00:00:59.640><c> trying</c><00:01:00.079><c> do</c><00:01:00.160><c> is</c><00:01:00.239><c> they</c><00:01:00.399><c> trying</c><00:01:00.760><c> to</c> what they're trying do is they trying to what they're trying do is they trying to get<00:01:02.000><c> as</c><00:01:02.120><c> many</c><00:01:02.320><c> people</c><00:01:02.519><c> in</c><00:01:02.600><c> the</c><00:01:02.719><c> funnel</c><00:01:03.039><c> as</c>

basically</c> possible so that they can basically possible so that they can basically Elevate<00:01:07.040><c> the</c><00:01:07.159><c> cream</c><00:01:07.400><c> of</c><00:01:07.520><c> the</c><00:01:07.799><c> crop</c><00:01:09.240><c> now</c><00:01:10.240><c> in</c> Elevate the cream of the crop now in Elevate the cream of the crop now in some<00:01:10.680><c> ways</c><00:01:11.000><c> that</c><00:01:11.200><c> kind</c><00:01:11.360><c> of</c><00:01:11.560><c> makes</c><00:01:12.080><c> sense</c><00:01:13.560><c> but</c> some ways that kind of makes sense but some ways that kind of makes sense but in<00:01:14.799><c> reality</c><00:01:15.439><c> it</c><00:01:15.840><c> is</c><00:01:16.640><c> completely</c><00:01:17.640><c> asinine</c><00:01:18.240><c> it</c> in reality it is completely asinine it in reality it is completely asinine it doesn't<00:01:18.920><c> make</c><00:01:19.159><c> sense</c><00:01:20.040><c> because</c><00:01:21.040><c> we've</c> doesn't make sense because we've doesn't make sense because we've completely<00:01:22.439><c> screwed</c><00:01:22.920><c> up</c><00:01:23.240><c> how</c><00:01:23.400><c> we</c><00:01:23.560><c> value</c> completely screwed up how we value completely screwed up how we value people<00:01:24.680><c> and</c><00:01:25.119><c> if</c><00:01:25.240><c>
