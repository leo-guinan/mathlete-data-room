a</c><00:05:31.880><c> mispriced</c><00:05:32.520><c> asset</c><00:05:33.360><c> and</c> right you find a mispriced asset and right you find a mispriced asset and then<00:05:34.120><c> you</c><00:05:35.080><c> figure</c><00:05:35.440><c> out</c><00:05:35.720><c> how</c><00:05:36.400><c> to</c><00:05:37.400><c> uh</c><00:05:37.840><c> leverage</c> then you figure out how to uh

fascinating<00:10:24.079><c> to</c><00:10:24.240><c> me</c><00:10:24.360><c> and</c><00:10:24.560><c> that's</c><00:10:24.920><c> uh</c><00:10:25.040><c> kind</c><00:10:25.160><c> of</c> fascinating to me and that's uh kind of fascinating to me and that's uh kind of what<00:10:25.399><c> brought</c><00:10:25.600><c> it</c><00:10:25.680><c> to</c><00:10:25.839><c> my</c><00:10:26.120><c> attention</c><00:10:27.120><c> um</c> what brought it to my attention um what brought it to my attention um because<00:10:27.760><c> frankly</c><00:10:28.120><c> I'm</c><00:10:28.240><c> not</c><00:10:28.440><c> paying</c><00:10:28.680><c> attention</c> because frankly I'm not paying attention because frankly I'm not paying attention to<00:10:29.320><c> readit</c><00:10:29.680><c> there</c><00:10:29.880><c> or</c><00:10:30.240><c> what's</c><00:10:30.480><c> happening</c><00:10:31.000><c> but</c> to readit there or what's happening but to readit there or what's happening but I<00:10:31.240><c> thought</c><00:10:31.399><c> this</c><00:10:31.519><c> was</c><00:10:31.680><c> a</c><00:10:32.320><c> like</c><00:10:32.440><c> a</c><00:10:32.560><c> phenomenal</c> I thought this was a like a phenomenal I thought this was a like a phenomenal uh<00:10:33.560><c> example</c><00:10:34.279><c> of</c><00:10:34.800><c> these</c><00:10:34.959><c> kind</c><00:10:35.079><c> of</c><00:10:35.200><c> principles</c> uh example of these kind of principles uh example of these kind of principles in<00:10:35.760><c> action</c><00:10:36.160><c> because</c><00:10:36.360><c> it</c><00:10:36.519><c> shows</c><00:10:36.800><c> you</c><00:10:36.959><c> how</c> in action because it shows you how in action because it shows you how powerful<00:10:38.560><c> information</c><00:10:39.200><c> can</c><00:10:39.399><c> be</c><00:10:39.639><c> and</c><00:10:39.839><c> how</c> powerful information can be and how powerful information can be and how valuable<00:10:40.639><c> that</c><00:10:40.839><c> information</c><00:10:41.320><c> can</c> valuable that information can valuable that information can be<00:10:43.040><c> and</c><00:10:43.200><c> so</c><00:10:43.560><c> it</c><00:10:43.680><c> sounds</c><00:10:44.000><c> like</c><00:10:44.200><c> basically</c><00:10:44.680><c> he</c> be and so it sounds like basically he be and so it sounds like basically he utilized<00:10:45.800><c> his</c><00:10:46.519><c> information</c><00:10:47.240><c> and</c><00:10:47.800><c> knowledge</c> utilized his information and knowledge utilized his information and knowledge understanding<00:10:49.279><c> how</c><00:10:49.680><c> to</c><00:10:50.680><c> bet</c><00:10:51.000><c> on</c><00:10:51.279><c> certain</c> understanding how to bet on certain understanding how to bet on certain things<00:10:51.760><c> happening</c><00:10:52.040><c> in</c><00:10:52.160><c> the</c><00:10:52.360><c> stock</c><00:10:52.839><c>

um<00:11:00.839><c> basically</c> um basically um basically like<00:11:03.920><c> borrowing</c><00:11:04.920><c> um</c><00:11:05.480><c> or</c><00:11:05.680><c> or</c><00:11:06.279><c> not</c><00:11:06.480><c> necessarily</c> like borrowing um or or not necessarily like borrowing um or or not necessarily borrowing<00:11:07.480><c> exactly</c><00:11:08.079><c> but</c><00:11:08.320><c> putting</c><00:11:09.160><c> options</c><00:11:10.160><c> uh</c> borrowing exactly but putting options uh borrowing exactly but putting options uh on<00:11:10.480><c> the</c><00:11:10.720><c> stock</c><00:11:11.040><c> to</c><00:11:11.279><c> say</c><00:11:11.839><c> hey</c><00:11:12.320><c> I</c><00:11:12.480><c> believe</c><00:11:12.760><c> this</c> on the stock to say hey I believe this on the stock to say hey I believe this is<00:11:13.000><c> going</c><00:11:13.120><c> to</c><00:11:13.279><c> go</c><00:11:13.440><c> up</c><00:11:13.720><c> and</c><00:11:13.839><c> so</c><00:11:14.560><c> when</c><00:11:14.800><c> prices</c><00:11:15.120><c> do</c> is going to go up and so when prices do is going to go up and so when prices do certain<00:11:15.760><c> things</c><00:11:16.760><c> um</c><00:11:17.720><c> start</c><00:11:18.320><c> you</c><00:11:18.440><c> know</c><00:11:19.279><c> buying</c> certain things um start you know buying certain things um start you know buying stock<00:11:20.040><c> or</c><00:11:20.279><c> whatever</c><00:11:21.360><c> um</c><00:11:22.360><c> and</c><00:11:23.240><c> again</c><00:11:24.240><c> the</c><00:11:24.399><c> stock</c> stock or whatever um and again the stock stock or whatever um and again the stock market<00:11:24.880><c> is</c><00:11:25.000><c> a</c><00:11:25.160><c> complex</c><00:11:25.600><c> thing</c><00:11:26.360><c> and</c><00:11:26.519><c> so</c><00:11:26.760><c> there's</c> market is a complex thing and so there's market is a complex thing and so there's all<00:11:27.240><c> sorts</c><00:11:27.480><c> of</c><00:11:27.680><c> different</c><00:11:27.959><c> ways</c><00:11:28.600><c> when</c><00:11:28.720><c> you</c> all sorts of different ways when you

this</c><00:11:33.480><c> is</c><00:11:33.639><c> one</c> complexity to make money and this is one complexity to make money and this is one of<00:11:33.880><c> my</c><00:11:34.040><c>

that can be exploited uh I<00:11:41.279><c> believe</c><00:11:41.600><c> that</c><00:11:41.720><c> we</c><00:11:41.880><c> really</c><00:11:42.079><c> need</c><00:11:42.240><c> to</c><00:11:42.360><c> move</c> I believe that we really need to move I believe that we really need to move towards<00:11:42.880><c> a</c><00:11:43.040><c> much</c><00:11:43.320><c> simpler</c><00:11:43.839><c>

basically focus of quantum economics to basically focus on<00:11:50.760><c> minimizing</c><00:11:51.519><c> this</c><00:11:52.040><c> uh</c><00:11:53.040><c> uh</c><00:11:53.279><c> Arbitrage</c> on minimizing this uh uh Arbitrage on minimizing this uh uh Arbitrage because<00:11:54.600><c> you</c><00:11:54.720><c> want</c><00:11:54.839><c> to</c><00:11:55.000><c> make</c><00:11:55.200><c> sure</c><00:11:55.519><c> that</c><00:11:55.800><c> the</c> because you want to make sure that the because you want to make sure that the information<00:11:56.440><c> in</c><00:11:56.600><c> the</c><00:11:56.760><c> economy</c><00:11:57.079><c> is</c><00:11:57.200><c> moving</c><00:11:57.560><c> as</c> information in the economy is moving as information in the economy is moving as

um<00:12:01.000><c> and</c><00:12:01.160><c> then</c><00:12:01.399><c> basically</c><00:12:02.399><c> any</c><00:12:02.680><c> weird</c><00:12:03.160><c> price</c><00:12:04.440><c> uh</c> um and then basically any weird price uh um and then basically any weird price uh uh<00:12:05.600><c> changes</c><00:12:06.320><c> are</c><00:12:06.760><c> a</c><00:12:07.360><c> function</c><00:12:08.760><c> of</c><00:12:09.760><c> inefficient</c> uh changes are a function of inefficient uh changes are a function of inefficient information<00:12:10.839><c> flows</c><00:12:11.560><c>

it</c><00:16:25.680><c> can</c><00:16:25.839><c> be</c> showing you how powerful uh it can be showing you how powerful uh it can be when<00:16:26.160><c> you</c><00:16:26.360><c> actually</c><00:16:26.920><c> understand</c><00:16:27.600><c> how</c><00:16:28.319><c> the</c> when you actually understand how the when you actually understand how the flow<00:16:28.639><c> of</c><00:16:28.959><c> information</c><00:16:29.639><c> impacts</c><00:16:30.160><c> pricing</c><00:16:30.839><c> and</c> flow of information impacts pricing and flow of information impacts pricing and um<00:16:33.000><c> yeah</c><00:16:33.199><c> how</c><00:16:33.319><c> to</c><00:16:33.800><c> use</c><00:16:34.120><c> that</c><00:16:34.279><c> type</c><00:16:34.399><c> of</c><00:16:34.519><c>
