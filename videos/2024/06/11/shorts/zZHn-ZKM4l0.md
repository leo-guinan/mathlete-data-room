biggest</c><00:00:02.960><c> complaints</c> and this is one of my biggest complaints and this is one of my biggest complaints with<00:00:03.480><c> the</c><00:00:03.560><c> current</c><00:00:03.840><c> economy</c><00:00:04.200><c> is</c><00:00:04.319><c> there's</c><00:00:04.520><c> so</c> with the current economy is there's so with the current economy is there's so much<00:00:04.960><c> complexity</c><00:00:05.960><c> there's</c><00:00:06.240><c> all</c><00:00:06.440><c> sorts</c><00:00:06.680><c> of</c> much complexity there's all sorts of much complexity there's all sorts of inefficiencies<00:00:07.520><c> that</c><00:00:07.640><c> can</c><00:00:07.720><c> be</c><00:00:08.320><c> exploited</c><00:00:09.320><c> uh</c> inefficiencies that can be exploited uh inefficiencies that can be exploited uh I<00:00:09.599><c> believe</c><00:00:09.880><c> that</c><00:00:10.040><c> we</c><00:00:10.200><c> really</c><00:00:10.400><c> need</c><00:00:10.559><c> to</c><00:00:10.679><c> move</c> I believe that we really need to move I believe that we really need to move towards<00:00:11.160><c> a</c><00:00:11.360><c> much</c><00:00:11.599><c> simpler</c><00:00:12.120><c> economy</c><00:00:12.599><c> which</c><00:00:12.679><c> is</c> towards a much simpler economy which is towards a much simpler economy which is the<00:00:13.000><c> idea</c><00:00:13.240><c> of</c><00:00:13.400><c> abundant</c><00:00:13.880><c> systems</c><00:00:14.480><c> and</c><00:00:14.839><c> uh</c><00:00:14.960><c> kind</c> the idea of abundant systems and uh kind the idea of abundant systems and uh kind of<00:00:15.160><c> quantum</c><00:00:15.760><c> economics</c><00:00:17.160><c> to</c><00:00:18.160><c> basically</c><00:00:18.560><c> focus</c> of quantum economics to basically focus of quantum economics to basically focus on<00:00:19.039><c> minimizing</c><00:00:19.840><c> this</c><00:00:20.359><c> uh</c><00:00:21.359><c> uh</c><00:00:21.480><c> Arbitrage</c> on minimizing this uh uh Arbitrage on minimizing this uh uh Arbitrage because<00:00:22.920><c> you</c><00:00:23.039><c> want</c><00:00:23.160><c> to</c><00:00:23.320><c> make</c><00:00:23.480><c> sure</c><00:00:23.800><c> that</c><00:00:24.119><c> the</c> because you want to make sure that the because you want to make sure that the information<00:00:24.760><c> in</c><00:00:24.920><c> the</c><00:00:25.039><c> economy</c><00:00:25.359><c> is</c><00:00:25.519><c> moving</c><00:00:25.880><c> as</c> information in the economy is moving as information in the economy is moving as quickly<00:00:26.480><c> and</c><00:00:26.640><c> efficiently</c><00:00:27.119><c> as</c><00:00:27.519><c> possible</c><00:00:28.519><c> um</c> quickly and efficiently as possible um quickly and efficiently as possible um and<00:00:29.400><c> then</c><00:00:29.560><c> basically</c> and then basically and then basically any<00:00:30.920><c> weird</c><00:00:31.439><c> price</c><00:00:32.719><c> uh</c><00:00:33.719><c> uh</c><00:00:33.840><c> changes</c><00:00:34.600><c> are</c><00:00:35.040><c> a</c> any weird price uh uh changes are a any weird price uh uh changes are a function<00:00:37.040><c> of</c><00:00:38.040><c> inefficient</c><00:00:38.680><c> information</c> function of inefficient information function of inefficient information flows<00:00:39.840><c> and</c><00:00:40.520><c> are</c><00:00:40.800><c> therefore</c><00:00:41.360><c> like</c><00:00:41.640><c> rewarded</c> flows and are therefore like rewarded flows and are therefore like rewarded and<00:00:42.320><c> fixed</c><00:00:42.840><c> and</c><00:00:43.039><c> and</c><00:00:43.120><c> so</c><00:00:43.360><c> basically</c><00:00:43.760><c> it's</c><00:00:43.960><c> like</c> and fixed and and so basically it's like and fixed and and so basically it's like considered<00:00:44.480><c> just</c><00:00:44.640><c> cost</c><00:00:44.840><c> of</c><00:00:44.960><c> doing</c><00:00:45.680><c> business</c> considered just cost of doing business considered just cost of doing business um<00:00:48.960><c> but</c><00:00:49.440><c> because</c><00:00:49.680><c> of</c><00:00:49.800><c> the</c><00:00:49.879><c> way</c><00:00:50.000><c> it</c><00:00:50.120><c> works</c><00:00:50.600><c> he</c> um but because of the way it works he um but because of the way it works he was<00:00:51.320><c> basically</c><00:00:51.640><c> able</c><00:00:51.840><c> to</c><00:00:52.399><c> take</c><00:00:53.399><c> uh</c><00:00:54.120><c> the</c><00:00:54.239><c> stock</c> was basically able to take uh the stock was basically able to take uh the stock that<00:00:54.559><c> he</c><00:00:54.640><c> don't</c><00:00:55.039><c> GameStop</c><00:00:55.920><c> and</c><00:00:56.399><c> convert</c><00:00:56.879><c> that</c> that he don't GameStop and convert that that he don't GameStop and convert that into<00:00:57.920><c> bets</c><00:00:58.440><c> on</c><00:00:58.719><c> the</c><00:00:58.840><c> price</c><00:00:59.079><c> going</c><00:00:59.359><c> up</c>
