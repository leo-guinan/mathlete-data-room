been</c><00:05:49.720><c> looking</c><00:05:50.000><c> at</c><00:05:50.319><c> is</c><00:05:50.479><c> really</c><00:05:50.759><c> this</c><00:05:51.000><c> idea</c> I've been looking at is really this idea I've been looking at is really this idea of<00:05:51.560><c> basically</c><00:05:52.400><c> providing</c><00:05:53.400><c> credit</c><00:05:54.039><c> and</c><00:05:54.199><c> so</c><00:05:54.600><c> if</c> of basically providing credit and so if of basically providing credit and so if you<00:05:54.840><c> have</c><00:05:54.960><c> a</c><00:05:55.080><c> community</c><00:05:55.440><c> with</c><00:05:55.560><c> a</c><00:05:55.680><c> bank</c><00:05:55.919><c> account</c> you have a community with a bank account you have a community with a bank account which<00:05:56.600><c> you</c><00:05:56.720><c> know</c><00:05:57.120><c> sometimes</c><00:05:58.000><c> people</c><00:05:58.280><c> refer</c><00:05:58.639><c> to</c> which you know sometimes people refer to which you know sometimes people refer to uh<00:06:00.000><c> Dows</c><00:06:00.360><c> or</c><00:06:00.520><c> decentralized</c><00:06:01.160><c> autonomous</c> uh Dows or decentralized autonomous uh Dows or decentralized autonomous organizations<00:06:02.360><c> like</c><00:06:02.600><c> that</c><00:06:03.600><c> um</c><00:06:04.600><c> but</c><00:06:04.720><c> in</c><00:06:04.880><c> this</c> organizations like that um but in this organizations like that um but in this case<00:06:05.479><c> I</c><00:06:05.600><c> I</c><00:06:05.680><c> think</c><00:06:05.800><c> it's</c><00:06:05.880><c> going</c><00:06:05.960><c> to</c><00:06:06.080><c> be</c><00:06:06.160><c> more</c> case I I think it's going to be more case I I think it's going to be more true<00:06:06.560><c> because</c><00:06:06.759><c> there's</c><00:06:06.960><c> going</c><00:06:07.039><c> to</c><00:06:07.280><c> be</c><00:06:07.440><c> kind</c><00:06:07.599><c> of</c> true because there's going to be kind of true because there's going to be kind of this<00:06:07.960><c> Core</c><00:06:08.840><c> Business</c><00:06:09.280><c> aspect</c><00:06:09.639><c>
