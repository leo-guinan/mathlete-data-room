just</c> was that if you can code you could just was that if you can code you could just build<00:01:45.640><c> whatever</c><00:01:46.000><c> you</c><00:01:46.479><c> want</c><00:01:47.479><c>

then um probably<00:08:38.959><c> ramp</c><00:08:39.240><c> it</c><00:08:39.360><c> up</c><00:08:39.519><c> to</c><00:08:39.680><c> about</c><00:08:39.919><c> $5</c><00:08:40.640><c> a</c><00:08:40.919><c> credit</c> probably ramp it up to about $5 a credit probably ramp it up to about $5 a credit uh<00:08:41.760><c> when</c><00:08:41.919><c> all</c><00:08:42.080><c>
