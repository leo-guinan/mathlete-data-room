at first I want to pop up my idea<00:01:38.799><c> slide</c><00:01:39.799><c> in</c><00:01:40.000><c> this</c><00:01:40.200><c> case</c><00:01:41.000><c> I'm</c><00:01:41.520><c> working</c><00:01:41.960><c> on</c> idea slide in this case I'm working on idea slide in this case I'm working on growing<00:01:42.920><c> my</c><00:01:43.079><c> newsletter</c><00:01:43.840><c> engineering</c> growing my newsletter engineering growing my newsletter engineering generosity<00:01:45.920><c> and</c><00:01:46.159><c> so</c><00:01:46.840><c> to</c><00:01:47.079><c>

learn how to build<00:01:54.719><c> systems</c><00:01:55.280><c> that</c><00:01:55.479><c> Inspire</c><00:01:55.960><c> an</c><00:01:56.159><c> abundance</c> build systems that Inspire an abundance build systems that Inspire an abundance mindset<00:01:58.560><c> honestly</c><00:01:59.240><c> I'm</c><00:01:59.320><c> a</c><00:01:59.399><c> little</c><00:01:59.560><c> torn</c><00:01:59.960><c> on</c><00:02:00.079><c> it</c> mindset honestly I'm a little torn on it mindset honestly I'm a little torn on it I<00:02:01.039><c> think</c><00:02:02.039><c> it</c><00:02:02.240><c> could</c><00:02:02.479><c> be</c><00:02:02.840><c> probably</c><00:02:03.240><c> a</c><00:02:03.360><c> little</c> I think it could be probably a little I think it could be probably a little cleaner<00:02:04.719><c> but</c><00:02:05.360><c> I</c><00:02:05.520><c> think</c><00:02:05.719><c> it</c><00:02:05.880><c> does</c><00:02:06.079><c> a</c><00:02:06.280><c> decent</c><00:02:06.719><c> job</c> cleaner but I think it does a decent job cleaner but I think it does a decent job of<00:02:07.600><c> capturing</c><00:02:08.119><c> the</c><00:02:08.239><c> overall</c><00:02:08.599><c> idea</c><00:02:09.160><c> I</c><00:02:09.239><c> think</c> of capturing the overall idea I think of capturing the overall idea I think most<00:02:09.640><c> people</c><00:02:10.080><c> kind</c><00:02:10.200><c> of</c><00:02:10.679><c> understand</c><00:02:10.879><c> what</c><00:02:11.000><c> an</c> most people kind of understand what an most people kind of understand what an abundance<00:02:11.599><c> mindset</c><00:02:12.080><c> is</c><00:02:12.879><c> kind</c><00:02:13.000><c> of</c><00:02:13.120><c> get</c><00:02:13.239><c> the</c> abundance mindset is kind of get the abundance mindset is kind of get the concept<00:02:13.680><c> of</c><00:02:13.879><c> systems</c><00:02:14.840><c> and</c><00:02:15.080><c> the</c><00:02:15.239><c> goal</c><00:02:15.480><c> is</c><00:02:15.920><c> to</c> concept of systems and the goal is to concept of systems and the goal is to learn<00:02:16.519><c> how</c><00:02:16.720><c> to</c><00:02:16.879><c> create</c><00:02:17.160><c> those</c><00:02:17.680><c> systems</c><00:02:18.680><c> um</c><00:02:18.959><c> and</c> learn how to create those systems um and learn how to create those systems um and then<00:02:19.160><c> the</c><00:02:19.319><c> description</c><00:02:20.040><c> so</c><00:02:20.879><c> a</c><00:02:21.000><c> newsletter</c><00:02:21.480><c> to</c> then the description so a newsletter to then the description so a newsletter to learn<00:02:21.879><c> from</c><00:02:22.800><c> a</c><00:02:23.239><c> community</c><00:02:24.280><c> to</c><00:02:25.280><c> connect</c><00:02:25.680><c> in</c><00:02:26.200><c> and</c> learn from a community to connect in and learn from a community to connect in and a<00:02:26.480><c> lab</c><00:02:26.959><c> to</c><00:02:27.599><c> experiment</c><00:02:28.160><c> in</c><00:02:28.959><c> and</c><00:02:29.120><c> so</c><00:02:29.440><c> this</c><00:02:29.560><c> is</c> a lab to experiment in and so this is a lab to experiment in and so this is actually<00:02:30.160><c> kind</c><00:02:30.280><c> of</c><00:02:30.400><c> the</c><00:02:30.599><c> three</c><00:02:30.959><c> tiered</c> actually kind of the

I</c><00:04:02.760><c> I</c><00:04:03.079><c> worked</c><00:04:03.319><c> on</c><00:04:03.480><c> for</c><00:04:03.640><c> a</c><00:04:03.760><c> bit</c><00:04:04.000><c> and</c><00:04:04.120><c> I</c><00:04:04.239><c> got</c> that I I I worked on for a bit and I got that I I I worked on for a bit and I got it<00:04:04.599><c> to</c><00:04:05.000><c> what</c><00:04:05.120><c> I</c><00:04:05.239><c> believe</c><00:04:05.439><c> is</c><00:04:05.560><c> a</c><00:04:05.680><c> pretty</c><00:04:05.920><c> high</c> it to what I believe is a pretty high it to what I believe is a pretty high quality<00:04:07.159><c> this</c><00:04:07.239><c> is</c><00:04:07.400><c> something</c><00:04:07.760><c> that</c><00:04:07.920><c> people</c> quality this is something that people quality this is something that people can<00:04:08.319><c> use</c><00:04:08.640><c> to</c><00:04:08.879><c> go</c><00:04:09.040><c> out</c><00:04:09.840><c> and</c><00:04:10.840><c> create</c><00:04:11.760><c> way</c><00:04:11.959><c> more</c> can use to go out and create way more can use to go out and create way more value<00:04:12.840><c> and</c><00:04:13.040><c> so</c><00:04:13.720><c> what</c><00:04:13.840><c> I</c><00:04:13.959><c> wanted</c><00:04:14.159><c> to</c><00:04:14.319><c> do</c><00:04:14.560><c> here</c><00:04:14.720><c> is</c> value and so what I wanted to do here is value and so what I wanted to do here is start<00:04:15.040><c> with</c><00:04:15.159><c> a</c><00:04:15.280><c> small</c><00:04:15.480><c> building</c><00:04:15.840><c> block</c><00:04:16.799><c> give</c> start with a small building block give start with a small building block give that<00:04:17.199><c> give</c><00:04:17.320><c> it</c><00:04:17.400><c> to</c><00:04:17.639><c> other</c><00:04:17.880><c> people</c><00:04:18.680><c> and</c><00:04:18.799><c> then</c> that give it to other people and then that give it to other people and then let<00:04:19.199><c> them</c><00:04:19.440><c> scale</c><00:04:19.880><c> that</c><00:04:20.040><c> up</c><00:04:20.239><c> and</c><00:04:20.359><c> build</c><00:04:20.680><c> that</c> let them scale that up and build that let them scale that up and build that more<00:04:21.320><c> to</c><00:04:21.560><c> really</c><00:04:21.759><c> see</c><00:04:22.000><c> what</c><00:04:22.199><c> they</c><00:04:22.360><c> can</c><00:04:22.520><c> do</c><00:04:22.759><c> with</c> more to really see what they can do with more to really see what they can do with it<00:04:23.560><c> and</c><00:04:23.840><c> so</c><00:04:24.320><c> it</c><00:04:24.400><c> means</c><00:04:24.639><c> that</c><00:04:24.800><c> I</c><00:04:24.880><c> don't</c> it and so it means that I don't it and so it means that I don't necessarily<00:04:25.520><c> have</c><00:04:25.600><c> to</c><00:04:25.720><c> go</c><00:04:25.840><c> out</c><00:04:25.960><c> and</c><00:04:26.120><c> find</c> necessarily have
