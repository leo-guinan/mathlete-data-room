whereas uh G GPT seems to be world today whereas uh G GPT seems to be a<00:03:01.200><c> little</c><00:03:01.480><c> outdated</c><00:03:02.000><c> in</c><00:03:02.159><c> some</c><00:03:02.319><c>

first</c><00:03:04.280><c> of</c><00:03:04.400><c> all</c><00:03:04.519><c> there</c><00:03:04.640><c> is</c> thinking and yeah first of all there is thinking and yeah first of all there is the<00:03:04.879><c> knowledge</c><00:03:05.200><c> cut</c><00:03:05.440><c> off</c><00:03:06.120><c> uh</c><00:03:06.959><c> 3.5</c><00:03:07.560><c> Sonet</c><00:03:08.000><c> I</c> the knowledge

I</c><00:04:21.680><c> thought</c><00:04:21.919><c> was</c><00:04:22.560><c> you</c><00:04:22.759><c> know</c> something uh that I thought was you know something uh that I thought was you know really<00:04:24.080><c> interesting</c><00:04:24.560><c> to</c><00:04:24.720><c> me</c><00:04:24.919><c> because</c><00:04:25.120><c> it's</c> really interesting to me because it's really interesting to me because it's not<00:04:25.479><c> something</c><00:04:25.759><c> I'd</c><00:04:25.880><c> ever</c><00:04:26.160><c> considered</c><00:04:26.759><c> before</c> not something I'd ever considered before not something I'd ever considered before but<00:04:27.919><c> she</c><00:04:28.160><c> said</c><00:04:29.039><c> that</c><00:04:29.400><c> you</c><00:04:29.520><c> know</c><00:04:29.919><c> poetry</c><00:04:30.600><c> is</c> but she said that you know poetry is but she said that you know poetry is actually<00:04:31.400><c> like</c><00:04:32.280><c> the</c><00:04:32.440><c> Forefront</c><00:04:33.280><c> of</c><00:04:33.520><c> language</c> actually like the Forefront of language actually like the Forefront of language so<00:04:34.720><c> it</c><00:04:34.840><c> is</c><00:04:35.160><c> the</c><00:04:35.680><c> it</c><00:04:35.759><c> is</c><00:04:35.960><c> where</c><00:04:36.280><c> language</c> so it is the it is where language so it is the it is where language evolves evolves evolves and<00:04:40.440><c> man</c><00:04:40.840><c> like</c><00:04:41.080><c> that's</c><00:04:41.280><c> such</c><00:04:41.440><c> a</c><00:04:41.680><c> powerful</c> and

on</c><00:04:43.320><c> to</c><00:04:43.520><c> talk</c> thing because then she went on to talk thing because then she went on to talk about<00:04:44.240><c> how</c><00:04:45.240><c> shakespear</c><00:04:46.120><c> used</c><00:04:46.680><c> the</c><00:04:46.960><c> sonnet</c><00:04:47.960><c> to</c> about how shakespear used the sonnet to about how shakespear used the sonnet to

this</c><00:09:58.600><c> idea</c><00:09:59.040><c> that</c> talking about was this idea that talking about was this idea that more<00:10:00.320><c> data</c><00:10:00.920><c>

oh</c><00:23:25.360><c> we</c><00:23:25.559><c> just</c><00:23:25.720><c> keep</c><00:23:25.960><c> that</c><00:23:26.080><c> money</c> just be like oh we just keep that money just be like oh we just keep that money and<00:23:26.480><c> build</c><00:23:26.720><c> out</c><00:23:26.919><c> more</c><00:23:27.200><c> stuff</c><00:23:27.440><c> for</c><00:23:27.640><c> me</c><00:23:28.840><c> um</c><00:23:29.400><c> and</c> and build out more stuff for me um and and build out more stuff for me um and so<00:23:31.000><c> I've</c><00:23:31.440><c> basically</c><00:23:32.440><c> raised</c><00:23:32.919><c> money</c><00:23:33.320><c> from</c> so I've basically raised money from so I've basically raised money from potential<00:23:34.000><c> users</c><00:23:34.679><c>

value</c><00:23:41.360><c> that</c> and then you know growing the value that and then you know growing the value that he's<00:23:41.760><c> creating</c><00:23:42.240><c> and</c><00:23:42.400><c> this</c><00:23:42.480><c> is</c><00:23:42.640><c> where</c><00:23:42.840><c> I</c><00:23:43.080><c> talk</c> he's creating and this is where I talk he's creating and this is where I talk about<00:23:43.559><c> the</c><00:23:43.679><c> idea</c><00:23:43.919><c> of</c><00:23:44.039><c> abundance</c><00:23:44.720><c> systems</c> about the idea of abundance systems about the idea of

with</c><00:24:14.279><c> abundant</c><00:24:14.760><c> systems</c><00:24:15.320><c> the</c> them um but with abundant systems the them um but with abundant systems the whole<00:24:15.640><c> thing</c><00:24:15.880><c> is</c><00:24:16.240><c> like</c><00:24:17.200><c> the</c><00:24:17.440><c> maximum</c><00:24:17.960><c> value</c><00:24:18.279><c> is</c> whole thing is like the maximum value is whole thing is like the maximum value is in<00:24:18.520><c> the</c><00:24:18.720><c> future</c><00:24:19.720><c> and</c><00:24:20.000><c> so</c><00:24:20.679><c> any</c><00:24:21.080><c> like</c><00:24:21.440><c> negative</c> in the future and so any like negative in the future and so any like negative behavior<00:24:22.279><c> by</c><00:24:22.480><c> participants</c><00:24:23.240><c> just</c><00:24:23.400><c> says</c><00:24:23.919><c> oh</c><00:24:24.919><c> I</c> behavior by participants just says oh I behavior by participants just says oh I don't<00:24:25.640><c> want</c><00:24:25.799><c> to</c><00:24:25.960><c> share</c><00:24:26.360><c> that</c><00:24:26.600><c> future</c><00:24:27.559><c> with</c> don't want to share that future with don't want to share that future with them<00:24:28.000><c> anymore</c> them anymore them anymore and<00:24:29.480><c> so</c><00:24:29.919><c> you</c><00:24:30.159><c> cut</c><00:24:30.360><c> them</c><00:24:30.520><c> out</c><00:24:30.640><c> of</c><00:24:30.760><c> any</c><00:24:30.960><c> potential</c> and so you cut them out of any potential and so you cut them out of any potential abundance<00:24:31.880><c> in</c><00:24:32.000><c> the</c><00:24:32.159><c> future</c><00:24:32.520><c> that</c><00:24:32.679><c> you</c><00:24:32.919><c> have</c> abundance in the future that you have abundance in the future that you have it's<00:24:33.840><c> a</c><00:24:33.960><c> filtering</c><00:24:34.960><c> mechanism</c><00:24:35.960><c> um</c><00:24:36.440><c> and</c><00:24:36.679><c> so</c><00:24:37.159><c> by</c> it's a filtering mechanism um and so by it's a filtering mechanism um and so by doing<00:24:37.600><c> the</c><00:24:37.720><c> work</c><00:24:38.000><c> first</c><00:24:38.320><c>

now</c><00:33:59.840><c> I</c><00:33:59.960><c> have</c><00:34:00.159><c> Z</c><00:34:00.880><c> resources</c> resources right now I have Z resources resources right now I have Z resources so<00:34:02.159><c> what's</c><00:34:02.399><c> the</c><00:34:02.559><c> first</c><00:34:02.799><c> step</c><00:34:03.039><c> I</c><00:34:03.120><c> can</c><00:34:03.279><c> do</c><00:34:03.480><c> for</c><00:34:03.720><c> Z</c> so what's the first step I can do for Z so what's the first step I can do for Z how<00:34:04.399><c> can</c><00:34:04.519><c> I</c><00:34:04.679><c> turn</c><00:34:05.000><c> Z</c><00:34:05.440><c> into</c> how can I turn Z into how can I turn Z into X<00:34:08.240><c> um</c> X um X um and<00:34:10.800><c> it's</c><00:34:11.240><c> a</c><00:34:11.599><c> future</c><00:34:12.639><c> focused</c><00:34:13.639><c> uh</c><00:34:13.960><c> mindset</c> and it's a future focused uh mindset and it's a future focused uh mindset it's<00:34:15.119><c> you</c><00:34:15.240><c> know</c><00:34:15.399><c> the</c><00:34:15.520><c> abundance</c><00:34:16.399><c> mindset</c> it's you know the abundance mindset it's you know the abundance mindset systematized<00:34:19.159><c> and</c><00:34:20.159><c> that's</c><00:34:20.359><c> why</c><00:34:20.480><c> I</c><00:34:20.560><c> believe</c><00:34:20.800><c> so</c> systematized
