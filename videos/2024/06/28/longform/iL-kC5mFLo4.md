what I was thinking thinking thinking and<00:05:15.880><c> that</c><00:05:16.000><c> really</c><00:05:16.199><c> got</c><00:05:16.360><c> me</c><00:05:16.520><c> thinking</c><00:05:16.840><c> around</c> and that really got me thinking around and that really got me thinking around the<00:05:17.400><c> possibilities</c><00:05:18.319><c> of</c><00:05:18.560><c> what</c><00:05:18.720><c> we've</c><00:05:18.960><c> got</c><00:05:19.240><c> here</c> the possibilities of what we've got here the possibilities of what we've got here now<00:05:20.360><c> the</c><00:05:20.479><c> answer</c><00:05:20.720><c> isn't</c><00:05:20.960><c> to</c><00:05:21.319><c> just</c><00:05:21.840><c> write</c><00:05:22.120><c> as</c> now the answer isn't to just write as now the answer isn't to just write as many<00:05:22.479><c> junk</c><00:05:22.800><c> papers</c><00:05:23.120><c> as</c><00:05:23.360><c> possible</c><00:05:24.080><c> and</c><00:05:24.360><c> like</c> many junk papers as

really</c><00:05:28.280><c> opens</c><00:05:28.600><c> up</c><00:05:28.759><c> a</c><00:05:28.960><c> ton</c><00:05:29.120><c> of</c> thinking but it really opens up a ton of thinking but it really opens up a ton of Poss<00:05:29.800><c> abilities</c><00:05:30.400><c> for</c><00:05:31.120><c> spending</c><00:05:32.120><c> all</c><00:05:32.319><c> your</c> Poss abilities for spending all your
