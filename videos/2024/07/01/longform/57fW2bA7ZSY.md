the ideas they're and I talk through the ideas they're really<00:01:16.400><c> receptive</c><00:01:16.840><c> to</c><00:01:17.000><c> what</c><00:01:17.119><c> I'm</c><00:01:17.280><c> talking</c>

ideas</c><00:01:19.640><c> I</c><00:01:19.759><c> just</c><00:01:19.920><c> have</c> about they do get the ideas I just have about they do get the ideas I just have to<00:01:20.159><c> be</c><00:01:20.240><c> able</c><00:01:20.439><c> to</c><00:01:20.600><c> explain</c><00:01:20.920><c> it</c><00:01:21.079><c> in</c><00:01:21.200><c> a</c><00:01:21.360><c> more</c> to be able to explain it in a more to be able to explain it in a more onetoone onetoone onetoone setting<00:01:24.400><c> but</c><00:01:24.560><c> how</c><00:01:24.640><c> do</c><00:01:24.759><c> you</c><00:01:24.920><c> do</c> setting but how do you do setting but how do you do that<00:01:26.720><c> without</c><00:01:27.040><c> the</c><00:01:27.159><c> onetoone</c><00:01:27.880><c> like</c><00:01:28.079><c> face</c><00:01:28.360><c> Toof</c> that without the onetoone like face Toof that without the onetoone like face Toof face<00:01:29.479><c> meeting</c> face meeting face meeting so<00:01:32.520><c> as</c><00:01:32.680><c> I</c><00:01:32.799><c> was</c><00:01:33.040><c> pondering</c><00:01:33.560><c> that</c><00:01:33.799><c> I</c><00:01:33.960><c> thought</c><00:01:34.399><c> hey</c> so as I was pondering that I thought hey so as I was pondering that I thought hey why<00:01:35.399><c> not</c><00:01:35.560><c> try</c><00:01:35.880><c> an</c><00:01:36.079><c> email</c><00:01:36.479><c> course</c><00:01:37.000><c> and</c><00:01:37.079><c> so</c> why not try an email course and so why not try an email course and so that's<00:01:37.520><c> exactly</c><00:01:37.880><c> what</c><00:01:38.000><c> I</c><00:01:38.119><c> put</c><00:01:38.439><c> together</c><00:01:39.439><c> I</c> that's exactly what I put together I that's exactly what I put together I went<00:01:39.759><c> ahead</c><00:01:40.200><c> and</c><00:01:40.360><c> built</c><00:01:40.680><c> a</c><00:01:40.880><c> 5-day</c><00:01:41.360><c> email</c> went ahead and built a 5-day email went ahead and built a 5-day email course<00:01:42.119><c> on</c><00:01:42.320><c> abundant</c><00:01:42.759><c> systems</c><00:01:43.119><c> for</c> course on abundant systems for course on abundant systems for creators<00:01:45.320><c> you</c><00:01:45.479><c> know</c><00:01:45.680><c> I</c><00:01:46.079><c> think</c><00:01:47.079><c> creators</c><00:01:47.759><c> are</c> creators you know I think creators are creators you know I think creators are really<00:01:48.520><c> at</c><00:01:48.680><c> the</c><00:01:48.840><c> Forefront</c><00:01:49.640><c> of</c><00:01:49.880><c> the</c><00:01:50.240><c> Abundant</c> really at the Forefront of the Abundant really at the Forefront of the Abundant future<00:01:51.159><c>

taking<00:01:53.000><c> ideas</c><00:01:54.000><c> and</c><00:01:54.280><c> crafting</c><00:01:54.880><c> them</c><00:01:55.280><c> and</c> taking ideas and crafting them and taking ideas and crafting them and delivering<00:01:56.000><c> them</c><00:01:56.200><c> to</c><00:01:56.759><c> people</c><00:01:57.000><c> who</c><00:01:57.119><c> need</c><00:01:57.320><c> to</c> delivering them to people who need to delivering them to people who need to hear<00:01:57.840><c> them</c><00:01:58.840><c> but</c><00:01:58.960><c> the</c><00:01:59.119><c> problem</c><00:01:59.439><c> is</c><00:02:00.280><c> as</c><00:02:00.479><c> creators</c> hear them but the problem is as creators hear them but the problem is as creators we<00:02:01.200><c> feel</c><00:02:01.439><c> a</c><00:02:01.600><c>

the</c><00:05:45.919><c> numbers</c> I don't actually care about the numbers I don't actually care about the numbers what<00:05:46.680><c> I</c><00:05:46.800><c> care</c><00:05:46.960><c> about</c><00:05:47.160><c> are</c><00:05:47.840><c> specific</c><00:05:48.520><c> people</c> what I care about are specific people what I care about are specific people and<00:05:49.720><c>

and I call this meaningful friction<00:06:03.720><c> and</c><00:06:03.840><c> this</c><00:06:03.960><c> is</c><00:06:04.080><c> a</c><00:06:04.280><c> concept</c><00:06:04.680><c> that</c><00:06:04.840><c> I've</c> friction and this is a concept that I've friction and this is a concept that I've really<00:06:05.319><c> been</c><00:06:05.560><c> thinking</c><00:06:05.919><c> about</c><00:06:06.599><c> because</c><00:06:07.599><c> all</c> really been thinking about because all really been thinking about because all too<00:06:07.960><c> often</c><00:06:08.680><c> we</c><00:06:08.960><c> try</c><00:06:09.120><c> to</c><00:06:09.280><c> reduce</c><00:06:09.560><c> friction</c> too often we try to reduce friction too often we try to reduce friction everywhere<00:06:10.280><c> we</c><00:06:10.400><c> want</c><00:06:10.479><c> to</c><00:06:10.599><c> make</c><00:06:10.720><c> it</c><00:06:10.840><c> as</c><00:06:11.039><c> easy</c><00:06:11.319><c> as</c> everywhere we want to make it as easy as everywhere we want to make it as easy as possible<00:06:11.840><c> for</c><00:06:12.000><c> people</c><00:06:12.160><c> to</c><00:06:12.319><c> go</c><00:06:12.440><c> from</c><00:06:12.599><c> point</c><00:06:12.800><c> A</c> possible for people to go from point A possible for people to go from point A to<00:06:13.080><c> point</c><00:06:13.319><c> B</c><00:06:14.120><c> and</c><00:06:14.199><c> so</c><00:06:14.319><c> a</c><00:06:14.400><c> lot</c><00:06:14.520><c> of</c><00:06:14.599><c> people</c><00:06:14.759><c> go</c> to point B and so a lot of people go to point B and so a lot of people go from<00:06:15.039><c> point</c><00:06:15.240><c> A</c><00:06:15.360><c> to</c><00:06:15.479><c> point</c><00:06:15.880><c> B</c><00:06:16.880><c> but</c><00:06:17.080><c> then</c><00:06:17.319><c> they're</c> from point A to point B but then they're from point A to point B but then they're at<00:06:17.639><c> point</c><00:06:17.840><c> B</c><00:06:18.000><c> and</c><00:06:18.080><c> they</c><00:06:18.160><c> don't</c><00:06:18.319><c> really</c><00:06:18.440><c> know</c> at point B and they don't really know at point B and they don't really know what<00:06:18.680><c> to</c><00:06:18.800><c> do</c><00:06:19.120><c> there</c><00:06:20.120><c> um</c><00:06:20.680><c> because</c><00:06:21.000><c> they</c><00:06:21.199><c> just</c> what to do there um because they just what to do there um because they just wound<00:06:21.960><c> up</c><00:06:22.240><c> there</c><00:06:22.639><c> that's</c><00:06:23.160><c> where</c><00:06:23.400><c> the</c> wound up there that's where the wound up there that's where the frictionless<00:06:24.120><c> path</c><00:06:24.400><c> took</c><00:06:24.840><c> them</c><00:06:25.840><c> and</c><00:06:26.080><c> so</c> frictionless path took them and so frictionless path took them and so instead<00:06:27.280><c> of</c><00:06:27.400><c> doing</c><00:06:27.599><c> it</c><00:06:27.840><c> that</c><00:06:28.000><c> way</c><00:06:28.280><c> I</c><00:06:28.360><c> wanted</c><00:06:28.599><c> to</c> instead of doing it that way I wanted to instead of doing it that way I wanted to introduce<00:06:29.199><c> this</c><00:06:29.319><c> me</c><00:06:29.560><c> meaningful</c><00:06:29.880><c> friction</c><00:06:30.400><c> as</c> introduce this me meaningful friction as introduce this me meaningful friction as a<00:06:30.680><c> way</c> a way a way to<00:06:32.680><c> get</c><00:06:32.880><c> them</c><00:06:33.199><c> to</c><00:06:34.120><c> think</c><00:06:34.400><c> about</c><00:06:34.919><c> whether</c><00:06:35.160><c> or</c> to get them to think about whether or to get them to think about whether or not<00:06:35.520><c> they</c><00:06:35.639><c> wanted</c><00:06:35.880><c> to</c><00:06:36.039><c> take</c><00:06:36.199><c> the</c><00:06:36.360><c> next</c><00:06:36.639><c> step</c> not they wanted to take the next step not they wanted to take the next step and<00:06:37.759><c> if</c><00:06:37.880><c> they</c><00:06:38.000><c> don't</c><00:06:38.440><c> that's</c><00:06:38.680><c> totally</c> and if they don't that's totally and if they don't that's totally fine<00:06:41.039><c> so</c><00:06:41.199><c> I</c><00:06:41.280><c> give</c><00:06:41.440><c> them</c><00:06:41.599><c> the</c><00:06:41.759><c> course</c><00:06:42.280><c> and</c><00:06:42.440><c> then</c> fine so I give

that's<00:08:54.680><c> fine</c><00:08:55.279><c> but</c><00:08:55.399><c> I</c><00:08:55.480><c> need</c><00:08:55.640><c> to</c><00:08:55.760><c> know</c><00:08:56.399><c> that</c><00:08:57.399><c> and</c> that's fine but I need to know that and that's fine but I need to know that and that's<00:08:58.480><c> why</c><00:08:59.160><c> putting</c><00:08:59.399><c> put</c><00:08:59.560><c>
