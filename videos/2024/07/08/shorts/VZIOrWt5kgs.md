Kind: captions Language: en I've<00:00:00.480><c> been</c><00:00:00.719><c> playing</c><00:00:01.000><c> around</c><00:00:01.280><c> a</c><00:00:01.439><c> bit</c><00:00:01.800><c> with</c><00:00:02.280><c> uh</c> I've been playing around a bit with uh I've been playing around a bit with uh Auto<00:00:03.040><c> GPT</c><00:00:04.040><c> uh</c><00:00:04.160><c> and</c><00:00:04.359><c> baby</c><00:00:04.640><c> AGI</c><00:00:05.600><c> if</c><00:00:05.680><c> you're</c><00:00:05.960><c> not</c> Auto GPT uh and baby AGI if you're not Auto GPT uh and baby AGI if you're not familiar<00:00:06.560><c> these</c><00:00:06.680><c> are</c><00:00:07.000><c> like</c><00:00:07.279><c> autonomous</c> familiar these are like autonomous familiar these are like autonomous agents<00:00:09.599><c> using</c><00:00:10.080><c> AI</c><00:00:10.519><c> to</c><00:00:10.719><c> be</c><00:00:10.880><c> able</c><00:00:11.160><c> to</c><00:00:11.480><c> complete</c> agents using AI to be able to complete agents using AI to be able to complete tasks<00:00:13.360><c> and</c><00:00:13.480><c> they're</c><00:00:13.679><c> still</c><00:00:13.920><c> very</c><00:00:14.120><c> early</c><00:00:14.559><c> on</c><00:00:15.559><c> in</c> tasks and they're still very early on in tasks and they're still very early on in their<00:00:17.279><c> Project</c><00:00:18.039><c> Life</c><00:00:19.039><c> they're</c><00:00:19.279><c> not</c> their Project Life they're not their Project Life they're not particularly<00:00:20.199><c> great</c><00:00:20.400><c> at</c><00:00:20.560><c> doing</c><00:00:20.800><c> anything</c> particularly great at doing anything particularly great at doing anything terribly<00:00:21.439><c> useful</c><00:00:21.800><c> yet</c><00:00:21.920><c> or</c><00:00:22.039><c> at</c><00:00:22.119><c> least</c><00:00:22.240><c> I</c> terribly useful yet or at least I terribly useful yet or at least I haven't<00:00:22.480><c> been</c><00:00:22.560><c> able</c><00:00:22.720><c> to</c><00:00:22.800><c> get</c><00:00:22.920><c> them</c><00:00:23.039><c> to</c><00:00:23.119><c> do</c> haven't been able to get them to do haven't been able to get them to do anything<00:00:24.519><c> um</c><00:00:24.800><c> but</c><00:00:24.960><c> the</c><00:00:25.080><c> idea</c><00:00:25.359><c> is</c><00:00:25.560><c> very</c><00:00:25.760><c> very</c> anything um but the idea is very very anything um but the idea is very very interesting<00:00:27.640><c> and</c><00:00:27.840><c> so</c><00:00:28.359><c> basically</c><00:00:29.359><c> you</c><00:00:29.560><c> give</c><00:00:29.679><c> it</c> interesting and so basically you give it interesting and so basically you give it a<00:00:30.080><c> task</c><00:00:30.759><c> and</c><00:00:30.960><c> the</c><00:00:31.160><c> AI</c><00:00:31.720><c> will</c><00:00:32.200><c> sit</c><00:00:32.520><c> there</c><00:00:32.800><c> and</c><00:00:33.040><c> try</c> a task and the AI will sit there and try a task and the AI will sit there and try to<00:00:34.879><c> figure</c><00:00:35.239><c> out</c><00:00:35.520><c> what</c><00:00:35.640><c> the</c><00:00:35.800><c> next</c><00:00:36.040><c> step</c><00:00:36.320><c> is</c> to figure out what the next step is to figure out what the next step is execute<00:00:37.079><c> that</c><00:00:37.239><c> next</c><00:00:37.480><c> step</c><00:00:38.120><c> and</c><00:00:38.320><c> kind</c><00:00:38.440><c> of</c> execute that next step and kind of execute that next step and kind of continuously<00:00:39.160><c> iterate</c><00:00:39.800><c> until</c><00:00:40.239><c> it</c><00:00:40.440><c> eventually</c> continuously iterate until it eventually continuously iterate until it eventually comes<00:00:41.079><c> to</c><00:00:41.239><c> some</c><00:00:41.840><c> result</c> comes to some result comes to some result um<00:00:44.960><c> it's</c><00:00:45.079><c> a</c><00:00:45.200><c> pretty</c><00:00:45.399><c> cool</c><00:00:45.640><c> concept</c><00:00:46.120><c> we'll</c><00:00:46.280><c> see</c> um it's a pretty cool concept we'll see um it's a pretty cool concept we'll see how<00:00:46.520><c> it</c><00:00:46.680><c> goes</c><00:00:47.199><c> but</c><00:00:47.800><c> uh</c><00:00:48.199><c> I</c><00:00:48.280><c> think</c><00:00:48.440><c> there's</c><00:00:48.600><c> going</c> how it goes but uh I think there's going how it goes but uh I think there's going to<00:00:48.800><c> be</c><00:00:48.920><c> some</c><00:00:49.039><c> usefulness</c><00:00:49.680><c> there</c><00:00:50.199><c> especially</c> to be some usefulness there especially to be some usefulness there especially once<00:00:50.719><c> you</c><00:00:50.840><c> start</c><00:00:51.000><c> to</c><00:00:51.160><c> give</c><00:00:51.280><c> it</c><00:00:51.440><c> extra</c> once you start to give it extra once you start to give it extra capabilities<00:00:53.480><c> um</c><00:00:54.440><c> you</c><00:00:54.559><c> know</c><00:00:54.680><c> on</c><00:00:54.879><c> top</c><00:00:55.000><c> of</c><00:00:55.120><c> what</c> capabilities um you know on top of what capabilities um you know on top of what it's<00:00:55.399><c> already</c><00:00:55.640><c> got</c>
