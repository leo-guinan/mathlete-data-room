**Description**:
Today's video takes a jump into the realities of content creation and with it most specifically, the exhaustion that comes without a 'big break' and the struggle of not playing by the YouTube algorithm's rules. 
However there is a twist in my journey; I've shifted my focus to create something innovative: my very own chatbot, a digital twin that acts as the perfect first point of contact and a personal search engine chat can assist to branch out far better.

my</c><00:01:30.000><c> content</c><00:01:30.479><c> on</c><00:01:30.680><c> my</c> that can leverage my content on my that can leverage my content on my behalf<00:01:32.000><c> and</c><00:01:32.159><c> help</c><00:01:32.360><c> me</c> behalf and help me behalf and help me avoid<00:01:34.640><c> the</c><00:01:34.799><c> damn</c><00:01:35.040><c> hamster</c><00:01:35.360><c> wheel</c><00:01:35.640><c> that</c><00:01:35.759><c> I'm</c> avoid the damn hamster wheel that I'm avoid the damn hamster wheel that I'm tired<00:01:36.200><c> of</c><00:01:36.360><c> running</c> tired of running tired of running on<00:01:38.560><c> so</c><00:01:39.439><c> basically</c><00:01:39.880><c> what</c><00:01:40.040><c> I</c><00:01:40.200><c> did</c><00:01:40.920><c>

I<00:01:44.600><c> went</c><00:01:44.840><c> ahead</c><00:01:45.159><c> and</c><00:01:45.439><c> created</c><00:01:46.280><c> a</c><00:01:46.479><c> submind</c><00:01:47.079><c> of</c> I went ahead and created a submind of I went ahead and created a submind of myself<00:01:47.960><c> which</c><00:01:48.079><c> was</c><00:01:48.280><c> actually</c><00:01:48.439><c> a</c><00:01:48.520><c>

I've talked about<00:05:54.240><c> this</c><00:05:54.479><c> before</c><00:05:55.400><c> where</c><00:05:55.759><c> it's</c><00:05:56.319><c> very</c><00:05:56.520><c> much</c> about this before where

about increasing your luck surface area about increasing your luck surface area but<00:05:59.720><c> the</c><00:05:59.840><c> problem</c><00:06:00.160><c> is</c><00:06:00.720><c> when</c><00:06:01.720><c> you</c><00:06:01.919><c> do</c><00:06:02.240><c> that</c> but the problem is when you do that but the problem is when you do that you're<00:06:02.840><c> kind</c><00:06:03.520><c> of</c><00:06:04.759><c> decreasing</c><00:06:06.039><c> like</c><00:06:07.039><c> the</c> you're kind of decreasing like the you're kind of decreasing like the

the</c><00:06:16.599><c> problem</c><00:06:16.840><c> with</c><00:06:17.000><c> solving</c> because I think the problem with solving because I think the problem with solving for<00:06:17.560><c> one</c> for one for one platform<00:06:19.479><c> is</c><00:06:19.800><c> that</c><00:06:20.639><c> uh</c><00:06:21.639><c> you</c><00:06:21.800><c> know</c><00:06:22.120><c> you</c><00:06:22.319><c> end</c><00:06:22.560><c> up</c> platform is that uh you know you end up platform is that uh you know you end up over<00:06:23.199><c> indexing</c><00:06:23.800><c> on</c><00:06:24.000><c> what</c><00:06:24.160><c> the</c><00:06:24.360><c> platform</c> over indexing on what the platform over indexing on what the platform values<00:06:25.759><c> and</c><00:06:26.120><c> not</c><00:06:26.360><c> enough</c><00:06:26.680><c> on</c><00:06:26.880><c> what</c><00:06:27.000><c> your</c> values and not enough on what your values and not enough on what your
