talk</c><00:06:16.120><c> about</c><00:06:16.479><c> that</c><00:06:17.440><c> and</c><00:06:18.199><c> basically</c><00:06:19.080><c> the</c><00:06:19.280><c> idea</c> I talk about that and basically the idea I talk about that and basically the idea is<00:06:20.240><c> that</c><00:06:20.400><c> I</c><00:06:20.560><c> give</c><00:06:20.680><c> it</c><00:06:20.840><c> a</c> is that I give it a is that I give it a topic<00:06:22.680><c> and</c><00:06:23.160><c> I</c> topic and I topic and I ask<00:06:25.120><c> it</c><00:06:25.319><c> to</c><00:06:25.639><c> I</c><00:06:25.800><c> ask</c><00:06:26.039><c> the</c><00:06:26.120><c> nlm</c><00:06:26.680><c> that</c><00:06:26.800><c> I'm</c><00:06:26.919><c> using</c> ask it to I ask the nlm that I'm using ask it to I ask the nlm that I'm using whether<00:06:27.599><c> it</c><00:06:27.720><c> be</c><00:06:27.919><c> Claud</c><00:06:28.280><c> or</c><00:06:28.400><c> GPT</c><00:06:29.800><c> um</c><00:06:30.039><c> either</c><00:06:30.280><c> one</c> whether it be Claud or GPT um either one whether it be Claud or GPT um either one and<00:06:31.240><c> I</c><00:06:31.360><c> ask</c><00:06:31.520><c> it</c><00:06:31.680><c> to</c><00:06:31.800><c> break</c><00:06:32.120><c> the</c><00:06:32.319><c> topic</c><00:06:32.680><c> down</c> and I ask it to break the topic down and I ask it to break the topic down into<00:06:33.720><c> five</c> into five into five subtopics<00:06:35.639><c> and</c><00:06:35.759><c> then</c><00:06:35.919><c> for</c><00:06:36.120><c> each</c><00:06:36.280><c> of</c><00:06:36.440><c> those</c> subtopics and then for each of those subtopics and then for each of those subtopics<00:06:37.319><c> I</c><00:06:37.560><c> ask</c><00:06:37.800><c> it</c><00:06:38.039><c> to</c><00:06:39.000><c> break</c><00:06:39.240><c> it</c><00:06:39.400><c> down</c><00:06:39.599><c> into</c> subtopics I ask it to break it down into subtopics I ask it to break it down into multiple multiple multiple questions<00:06:41.840><c> and</c><00:06:42.000><c> so</c><00:06:42.240><c> a</c><00:06:42.319><c> lot</c><00:06:42.440><c> of</c><00:06:42.560><c> times</c><00:06:42.759><c> this</c> questions and so a lot of times this questions and so a lot of times this will<00:06:43.000><c> be</c><00:06:43.199><c> like</c><00:06:43.360><c> 10</c><00:06:43.560><c> to</c><00:06:43.759><c> 15</c><00:06:44.160><c> questions</c><00:06:44.639><c> per</c> will be like 10 to 15 questions per will be like 10 to 15 questions per subtopic<00:06:46.400><c> and</c><00:06:46.520><c> then</c><00:06:46.599><c> I'll</c><00:06:46.759><c> have</c><00:06:46.840><c> it</c><00:06:47.000><c> go</c> subtopic and then I'll have it go subtopic and then I'll have it go through<00:06:47.360><c> and</c><00:06:47.720><c> answer</c><00:06:48.360><c> all</c><00:06:48.560><c> of</c><00:06:48.759><c> those</c> through and answer all of those through and answer all of those questions<00:06:50.759><c> and</c><00:06:50.960><c> then</c><00:06:51.520><c> it</c><00:06:52.360><c> summarizes</c><00:06:53.360><c> the</c> questions and then it summarizes the questions and then it summarizes the questions<00:06:54.080><c> at</c><00:06:54.199><c> the</c><00:06:54.319><c> subtopic</c><00:06:54.840><c> level</c><00:06:55.360><c> and</c><00:06:55.479><c> then</c> questions at the subtopic level and then questions at the subtopic level and then it<00:06:55.759><c> summarizes</c><00:06:56.479><c> all</c><00:06:56.680><c> the</c><00:06:56.840><c> subtopics</c><00:06:57.639><c> at</c><00:06:58.120><c> the</c> it summarizes all the subtopics at the it summarizes all the subtopics at the parent<00:06:58.639><c> topic</c><00:06:59.000><c> level</c><00:06:59.720><c> so</c><00:06:59.879><c> it</c><00:07:00.000><c> creates</c><00:07:00.319><c> this</c> parent topic level so it creates this parent topic level so it creates this kind<00:07:00.599><c> of</c><00:07:00.720><c> recursive</c><00:07:01.360><c> tree</c><00:07:02.360><c> and</c><00:07:02.520><c> what</c><00:07:02.680><c> I</c><00:07:02.879><c> found</c> kind of recursive tree and what I found kind of recursive tree and what I found is<00:07:03.800><c> that</c><00:07:04.400><c> within</c><00:07:04.960><c> the</c><00:07:05.319><c>

responses and so I found that topical um responses and so I found that this<00:07:40.479><c> is</c><00:07:40.599><c> a</c><00:07:40.879><c> really</c><00:07:41.280><c> good</c><00:07:41.720><c> and</c><00:07:41.960><c> cheap</c><00:07:42.759><c> way</c><00:07:43.759><c> of</c> this is a really good and cheap way of this is a really good and cheap way of constraining<00:07:44.639><c> llms</c><00:07:45.479><c> on</c><00:07:45.680><c> a</c><00:07:45.840><c> given</c><00:07:46.400><c> topic</c><00:07:47.400><c> and</c> constraining llms on a given topic and constraining llms on a

you can't really do this on all so you can't really do this on all topics<00:07:49.680><c> because</c><00:07:49.879><c> then</c><00:07:50.000><c> you</c><00:07:50.120><c> just</c><00:07:50.319><c> end</c><00:07:50.479><c> up</c><00:07:50.639><c> with</c> topics because then you just end up with topics because then you just end up with like<00:07:51.039><c> all</c><00:07:51.280><c> late</c><00:07:51.479><c> in</c><00:07:51.680><c> space</c><00:07:52.039><c> again</c><00:07:52.879><c> um</c><00:07:53.000><c> so</c><00:07:53.120><c> it</c> like all late in space again um so it like all late in space again um so it doesn't<00:07:53.479><c> solve</c><00:07:53.680><c> the</c><00:07:53.840><c> problem</c><00:07:54.159><c> but</c><00:07:54.280><c> when</c><00:07:54.400><c>
