also<00:06:14.960><c> really</c><00:06:15.160><c> want</c><00:06:15.240><c> to</c><00:06:15.360><c> play</c><00:06:15.599><c> around</c><00:06:15.880><c> kind</c><00:06:15.960><c> of</c> also really want to play around kind of also really want to play around kind of fine-tuning<00:06:16.759><c> some</c><00:06:16.880><c> of</c><00:06:17.039><c> these</c><00:06:17.240><c> too</c><00:06:17.560><c> because</c><00:06:17.800><c> I</c> fine-tuning some of these too because I fine-tuning some of these too because I think<00:06:18.639><c> there's</c><00:06:18.880><c> a</c><00:06:19.160><c> really</c><00:06:19.520><c> good</c><00:06:19.880><c> market</c><00:06:20.960><c> for</c> think there's a really good market for think there's a really good market for fine-tune<00:06:22.479><c> models</c><00:06:22.960><c> around</c><00:06:23.360><c> very</c><00:06:23.720><c> specific</c> fine-tune models around very specific fine-tune models around very specific applications<00:06:25.919><c> and</c><00:06:26.919><c> you</c><00:06:27.039><c> know</c><00:06:27.199><c> there's</c><00:06:27.479><c> been</c><00:06:27.599><c> a</c> applications and you know there's been a applications and you know there's been a lot<00:06:27.800><c> of</c><00:06:27.919><c> research</c><00:06:28.319><c> to</c><00:06:28.479><c> show</c><00:06:28.800><c> that</c><00:06:28.960><c> if</c><00:06:29.080><c> you</c> lot of research to show that if you lot of research to show that if you uh<00:06:30.720><c> you</c><00:06:30.840><c> can</c><00:06:31.000><c> actually</c><00:06:31.199><c> use</c><00:06:31.440><c> bigger</c><00:06:31.759><c> models</c><00:06:32.280><c> to</c> uh you can actually use bigger models to uh you can actually use bigger models to train<00:06:33.720><c> smaller</c><00:06:34.120><c> ones</c><00:06:34.639><c> and</c><00:06:34.840><c> and</c><00:06:35.000><c> basically</c><00:06:35.479><c> say</c> train smaller ones and and basically say train smaller ones and and basically say hey<00:06:36.960><c> this</c><00:06:37.120><c> is</c><00:06:37.440><c> how</c><00:06:38.240><c> you</c><00:06:38.440><c> take</c><00:06:38.880><c> this</c><00:06:39.120><c> input</c><00:06:39.599><c> and</c> hey this is how you take this input and hey this is how you take this input and create<00:06:40.160><c> this</c><00:06:40.560><c> output</c><00:06:41.560><c> and</c><00:06:41.720><c> then</c><00:06:41.960><c> you</c><00:06:42.120><c> use</c><00:06:42.360><c> that</c> create this output and then you use that create this output and then you use that as<00:06:42.599><c> an</c><00:06:42.759><c> example</c><00:06:43.080><c> to</c><00:06:43.199><c> show</c><00:06:43.400><c> the</c><00:06:43.479><c> smaller</c><00:06:43.880><c> model</c> as an example to show the smaller model as an example to show the smaller model and<00:06:44.680><c> then</c><00:06:44.800><c> you</c><00:06:44.960><c> end</c><00:06:45.199><c> up</c><00:06:45.400><c> getting</c><00:06:45.960><c> the</c><00:06:46.080><c> same</c> and then you end up getting the same and then you end up getting the same results<00:06:46.840><c> at</c><00:06:46.960><c> a</c><00:06:47.120><c> lower</c><00:06:47.800><c> cost</c><00:06:48.800><c> uh</c><00:06:48.960><c> so</c><00:06:49.120><c> I'm</c><00:06:49.280><c> really</c> results at a lower cost uh so I'm really results at a lower cost uh so I'm really interested<00:06:50.160><c> to</c><00:06:50.360><c> see</c><00:06:50.800><c> if</c><00:06:51.039><c> this</c><00:06:51.160><c> is</c><00:06:51.360><c> something</c> interested to see if this is something interested to see if this is something that<00:06:52.400><c> is</c><00:06:53.240><c> possible</c><00:06:54.240><c> um</c><00:06:54.759><c> by</c><00:06:54.960><c> kind</c><00:06:55.080><c> of</c><00:06:55.319><c> like</c> that is possible um by kind of like that is possible um by kind of like fine-tuning<00:06:56.160><c> some</c><00:06:56.280><c> of</c><00:06:56.479><c> these</c><00:06:56.720><c> like</c><00:06:56.919><c> smaller</c> fine-tuning some of these like smaller fine-tuning some of these like smaller llama<00:06:58.240><c> 3.1</c><00:06:59.000><c> models</c> llama 3.1 models llama 3.1 models um<00:07:01.479><c> also</c><00:07:01.840><c> I</c><00:07:02.000><c> have</c><00:07:02.160><c> to</c><00:07:02.400><c> say</c><00:07:02.960><c> this</c><00:07:03.080><c> is</c><00:07:03.240><c> really</c> um also I have to say this is really um also I have to say this is really funny<00:07:03.800><c> to</c><00:07:03.919><c> me</c><00:07:04.120><c> too</c><00:07:05.039><c> because</c><00:07:05.319><c> if</c><00:07:05.440><c> you</c><00:07:05.639><c> look</c><00:07:05.840><c> at</c> funny to me too because if you look at funny to me too because if you look at kind<00:07:06.360><c> of</c><00:07:06.720><c> the</c><00:07:07.560><c> numbering</c><00:07:08.000><c> conventions</c><00:07:08.800><c> right</c> kind of the numbering conventions right kind of the numbering conventions right so<00:07:09.319><c> you</c><00:07:09.520><c> go</c><00:07:09.840><c> from</c><00:07:10.199><c> like</c><00:07:10.919><c> gpt3</c><00:07:11.919><c> to</c><00:07:12.120><c> GPT</c><00:07:12.599><c> 3.5</c><00:07:13.560><c> to</c> so you go from like gpt3 to GPT 3.5 to so you go from like gpt3 to GPT 3.5 to GPT<00:07:14.199><c> 4</c><00:07:14.720><c> to</c><00:07:14.879><c> GPT</c><00:07:15.360><c> 4</c><00:07:16.240><c> to</c><00:07:16.440><c> GPT</c><00:07:16.840><c> 40</c><00:07:17.440><c> mini</c><00:07:18.440><c> and</c><00:07:18.840><c> so</c> GPT 4 to GPT 4 to GPT 40 mini and so GPT 4 to GPT 4 to GPT 40 mini and so we're<00:07:19.479><c> kind</c><00:07:19.680><c> of</c><00:07:20.000><c> going</c><00:07:20.319><c> on</c><00:07:20.879><c> weird</c> we're kind of going on weird we're kind of going on weird progressions<00:07:21.879><c> right</c><00:07:22.879><c> um</c><00:07:23.160><c> and</c><00:07:23.280><c> then</c><00:07:23.400><c> you've</c> progressions right um and then you've progressions right um and then you've got<00:07:23.960><c> like</c><00:07:24.800><c> Claude</c><00:07:25.599><c> going</c><00:07:25.879><c> to</c><00:07:26.080><c> Claude</c><00:07:26.560><c> 3</c><00:07:27.560><c> and</c> got like Claude going to Claude 3 and got like Claude going to Claude 3 and you<00:07:27.800><c> know</c><00:07:28.000><c> then</c><00:07:28.120><c> you've</c><00:07:28.280><c> got</c><00:07:28.479><c> Claude</c><00:07:28.879><c> 3</c> you know then you've got Claude 3 you know then you've got Claude 3 uh<00:07:30.360><c> Sonet</c><00:07:30.879><c> Haiku</c><00:07:31.400><c> and</c><00:07:31.560><c>

the</c><00:09:43.760><c> uh</c><00:09:43.920><c> the</c><00:09:44.120><c> smaller</c><00:09:45.120><c> um</c><00:09:46.040><c> I</c><00:09:46.120><c> think</c> back to the uh the smaller um I think back to the uh the smaller um I think llama<00:09:46.560><c> 3</c><00:09:46.720><c> is</c><00:09:46.800><c> a</c><00:09:46.920><c> 7</c><00:09:47.200><c> billion</c><00:09:48.160><c> parameter</c><00:09:48.880><c> model</c> llama 3 is a 7 billion parameter model llama 3 is a 7 billion parameter model uh<00:09:49.920><c> and</c><00:09:50.040><c> then</c><00:09:50.160><c> llama</c><00:09:50.480><c> 3.1</c><00:09:50.959><c> is</c><00:09:51.120><c> 8</c><00:09:51.360><c> billion</c><00:09:52.279><c> so</c><00:09:53.279><c> um</c> uh and then llama 3.1 is 8 billion so um uh and then llama 3.1 is 8 billion so um yeah<00:09:54.360><c> just</c><00:09:54.519><c> continuing</c><00:09:54.920><c> to</c><00:09:55.079><c> play</c><00:09:55.240><c> with</c><00:09:55.440><c> that</c> yeah just continuing to play with that yeah just continuing to play with that level<00:09:55.920><c> of</c><00:09:56.079><c> it</c><00:09:56.360><c> maybe</c><00:09:56.640><c>
