I</c><00:00:25.359><c> just</c><00:00:25.599><c> saw</c> talk about a new paper that I just saw talk about a new paper that I just saw that<00:00:26.279><c> was</c><00:00:26.560><c> published</c><00:00:27.119><c> in</c> that was published in that was published in nature<00:00:29.359><c> and</c><00:00:30.240><c> what</c><00:00:30.359><c> it</c><00:00:30.560><c> does</c><00:00:31.000><c> is</c><00:00:31.160><c> it</c><00:00:31.400><c> actually</c> nature and what it does is it actually nature and what it does is it actually shows<00:00:32.800><c> that</c><00:00:33.760><c> AI</c><00:00:34.360><c> models</c><00:00:35.360><c> trained</c><00:00:36.040><c> on</c> shows that AI models trained on shows that AI models trained on synthetic<00:00:37.520><c> data</c><00:00:37.840><c> that</c><00:00:38.040><c> they've</c><00:00:38.559><c> produced</c><00:00:39.559><c> end</c> synthetic data that they've produced end synthetic data that they've produced end up<00:00:40.239><c> collapsing</c><00:00:41.239><c> into</c><00:00:41.760><c> the</c> up collapsing into the up collapsing into the model<00:00:43.559><c> and</c><00:00:43.920><c> the</c><00:00:44.000><c> model</c><00:00:44.200><c> falls</c><00:00:44.480><c> apart</c> model and the model falls apart model and the model falls apart basically<00:00:46.079><c> and</c><00:00:46.320><c> this</c><00:00:46.480><c> is</c><00:00:46.879><c> actually</c><00:00:47.600><c> something</c> basically and this is actually something basically and this is actually something that<00:00:48.480><c> I</c><00:00:48.559><c> am</c><00:00:48.840><c> not</c><00:00:49.079><c> surprised</c><00:00:49.559><c> at</c><00:00:49.680><c> all</c><00:00:49.800><c> to</c> that I am not surprised at all to that I am not surprised at all to hear<00:00:51.520><c> uh</c><00:00:51.760><c> and</c><00:00:51.960><c> in</c><00:00:52.239><c> fact</c><00:00:52.760><c> as</c><00:00:52.960><c> I</c><00:00:53.160><c> was</c><00:00:53.600><c> really</c> hear uh and in fact as I was really hear uh and in fact as I was really thinking<00:00:54.399><c> through</c><00:00:54.600><c> the</c><00:00:54.760><c> ramifications</c><00:00:55.520><c> of</c> thinking through the ramifications of thinking through the ramifications of this<00:00:56.719><c> I</c><00:00:56.840><c> realized</c><00:00:57.320><c> there's</c><00:00:57.640><c> a</c><00:00:57.960><c> really</c><00:00:58.879><c> tight</c> this I realized there's a really tight this I realized there's a really tight correlation correlation correlation into<00:01:01.559><c> what</c><00:01:01.719><c> I</c><00:01:01.879><c> end</c><00:01:02.039><c> up</c><00:01:02.280><c> seeing</c><00:01:02.960><c> on</c><00:01:03.519><c> Creator</c> into what I end up seeing on Creator into what I end up seeing on Creator platforms<00:01:05.880><c> um</c><00:01:06.439><c> but</c><00:01:06.880><c> so</c><00:01:07.280><c> to</c><00:01:07.479><c> start</c><00:01:07.759><c> off</c><00:01:08.040><c> I</c><00:01:08.119><c> want</c> platforms um but so to start off I want platforms um but so to start off I want to<00:01:08.360><c> talk</c><00:01:08.520><c> about</c><00:01:08.720><c> synthetic</c><00:01:09.119><c> data</c><00:01:09.360><c> at</c><00:01:09.479><c> all</c> to talk about synthetic data at all to talk about synthetic data at all because<00:01:10.400><c> uh</c><00:01:10.640><c> you</c><00:01:11.119><c> talk</c><00:01:11.320><c> about</c><00:01:11.520><c> synthetic</c><00:01:11.920><c> data</c> because uh you talk about synthetic data because uh you talk about synthetic data a<00:01:12.320><c> little</c><00:01:12.560><c> bit</c><00:01:12.960><c> because</c><00:01:13.400><c> I</c><00:01:13.600><c> don't</c><00:01:13.880><c> think</c><00:01:14.119><c> a</c><00:01:14.240><c> lot</c> a little bit because I don't think a lot a little bit because I don't think a lot of<00:01:14.560><c> people</c><00:01:15.040><c> actually</c><00:01:15.880><c> know</c><00:01:16.159><c> what</c><00:01:16.280><c> synthetic</c> of people actually know what synthetic of people actually know what synthetic data<00:01:17.159><c> is</c><00:01:18.159><c> and</c><00:01:18.439><c> as</c><00:01:18.520><c> you</c><00:01:18.720><c> may</c><00:01:18.880><c> have</c><00:01:19.040><c> been</c><00:01:19.159><c> able</c><00:01:19.360><c> to</c> data is and as you may have been able to data is and as you may have been able to tell<00:01:19.680><c> from</c><00:01:19.799><c> the</c><00:01:19.920><c> name</c><00:01:20.200><c> synthetic</c><00:01:20.680><c> data</c><00:01:21.000><c> is</c> tell from the name synthetic data is tell from the name synthetic data is data<00:01:21.680><c> that</c><00:01:21.960><c> is</c><00:01:22.960><c> generated</c><00:01:23.520><c> it's</c><00:01:23.720><c> created</c><00:01:24.479><c> it's</c> data that is generated it's created it's data that is generated it's created it's not<00:01:25.280><c> collected</c><00:01:25.920><c> from</c><00:01:26.240><c> like</c><00:01:26.400><c> how</c><00:01:26.600><c> people</c><00:01:26.880><c> use</c> not collected from like how people use not collected from like how people use it<00:01:27.600><c> or</c><00:01:27.799><c> you</c><00:01:27.920><c> know</c><00:01:28.119><c> what</c><00:01:28.280><c> inputs</c><00:01:28.720><c> they</c><00:01:28.880><c> use</c> it or you know what inputs they use it or you know what inputs they use basically<00:01:31.280><c> one</c><00:01:31.439><c> of</c><00:01:31.720><c> the</c><00:01:32.640><c> hypothetical</c><00:01:33.479><c> things</c> basically one of the hypothetical things basically one of the hypothetical things that<00:01:34.680><c> a</c><00:01:34.799><c> lot</c><00:01:34.920><c> of</c><00:01:35.079><c> researchers</c><00:01:35.560><c> are</c><00:01:35.680><c> throwing</c> that a lot of researchers are throwing that a lot of researchers are throwing out<00:01:36.240><c> there</c><00:01:36.439><c> is</c><00:01:36.640><c> like</c><00:01:36.960><c> oh</c><00:01:37.280><c> well</c><00:01:38.000><c> you</c><00:01:38.119><c> know</c><00:01:38.360><c> we've</c> out there is like oh well you know we've out there is like oh well you know we've kind<00:01:38.680><c> of</c><00:01:38.799><c> trained</c><00:01:39.079><c> on</c><00:01:39.200><c> the</c><00:01:39.320><c> whole</c><00:01:39.479><c> internet</c> kind of trained on the whole internet kind of trained on the whole internet now<00:01:40.520><c> what's</c><00:01:40.920><c> next</c><00:01:41.880><c> maybe</c><00:01:42.159><c> we</c><00:01:42.280><c> can</c><00:01:42.479><c> just</c><00:01:42.680><c> train</c> now what's next maybe we can just train now what's next maybe we can just train on<00:01:43.200><c> a</c><00:01:43.360><c> whole</c><00:01:43.600><c> bunch</c><00:01:44.240><c> of</c><00:01:44.840><c> like</c><00:01:45.399><c> fake</c><00:01:45.680><c> data</c><00:01:46.040><c> that</c> on a whole bunch of like fake data that on a whole bunch of like fake data that we<00:01:46.280><c> generated</c><00:01:46.920><c> and</c><00:01:47.040><c> create</c><00:01:47.520><c> all</c><00:01:47.680><c> of</c><00:01:47.799><c> these</c><00:01:47.960><c> use</c> we generated and create all of these use we generated and create all of these use cases<00:01:48.600><c> and</c><00:01:48.719><c> train</c><00:01:48.960><c> on</c> cases and train on cases and train on that<00:01:51.399><c> turns</c><00:01:51.680><c> out</c><00:01:51.960><c> that</c><00:01:52.119><c> doesn't</c><00:01:52.560><c> actually</c> that turns out that doesn't actually that turns out that doesn't actually work<00:01:54.479><c> and</c><00:01:54.920><c> again</c><00:01:55.320><c> I'm</c><00:01:55.560><c> not</c><00:01:56.039><c> really</c><00:01:56.320><c> surprised</c> work and again I'm not really surprised work and again I'm not really surprised by<00:01:57.039><c> this</c><00:01:57.840><c> it</c><00:01:58.200><c> actually</c><00:01:58.520><c> makes</c><00:01:58.759><c> a</c><00:01:58.880><c> lot</c><00:01:59.000><c> of</c><00:01:59.119><c> sense</c> by this it actually makes a lot of sense by this it actually makes a lot of sense to<00:01:59.479><c> me</c> to me to me because<00:02:01.439><c> especially</c><00:02:01.880><c> when</c><00:02:02.000><c> it</c><00:02:02.159><c> comes</c><00:02:02.479><c> to</c> because especially when it comes to because especially when it comes to human human human language<00:02:05.439><c> there</c><00:02:05.880><c> is</c><00:02:06.399><c> a</c><00:02:06.880><c> lot</c><00:02:07.200><c> of</c><00:02:07.399><c> the</c><00:02:07.560><c> world</c> language there is a lot of the world language there is a lot of the world that<00:02:08.160><c> gets</c><00:02:08.520><c> represented</c><00:02:09.319><c> in</c><00:02:09.440><c> our</c><00:02:09.679><c> language</c> that gets represented in our language that gets represented in our language that<00:02:10.200><c> we</c><00:02:10.680><c>

and so they replace it with curation and so they replace it with this<00:04:18.479><c> AI</c><00:04:19.280><c> system</c><00:04:20.280><c> and</c><00:04:20.639><c> it</c><00:04:20.799><c> becomes</c><00:04:21.120><c> less</c> this AI system and it becomes less this AI system and it becomes less valuable<00:04:21.959><c> but</c><00:04:22.160><c> you</c><00:04:22.320><c> know</c><00:04:23.000><c> things</c><00:04:23.280><c> start</c><00:04:23.759><c> going</c> valuable but you know things start going valuable but you know things start going but<00:04:25.600><c> what</c><00:04:25.840><c> happens</c><00:04:26.400><c> is</c><00:04:26.680><c> actually</c><00:04:27.120><c> the</c> but what happens is actually the but what happens is actually the audience<00:04:27.840><c> shifts</c><00:04:28.520><c> because</c><00:04:29.280><c> where</c><00:04:29.440><c> you</c><00:04:29.720><c> start</c> audience shifts because where you start audience shifts because where you start off<00:04:30.039><c> with</c><00:04:30.160><c> writers</c><00:04:30.560><c> who</c><00:04:30.680><c> are</c><00:04:30.840><c> getting</c><00:04:31.240><c> readers</c> off with writers who are getting readers off with writers who are getting readers you<00:04:32.400><c> now</c><00:04:32.639><c> have</c><00:04:32.880><c> writers</c><00:04:33.320><c> who</c><00:04:33.440><c>

up</c><00:04:56.520><c> overloading</c><00:04:57.120><c> the</c><00:04:57.280><c> data</c> completely ends up overloading the data completely ends up overloading the data because<00:04:57.960><c> these</c><00:04:58.120><c> are</c><00:04:58.280><c> the</c><00:04:58.400><c> people</c><00:04:58.639><c> spending</c> because these are the people spending because these are the people spending the<00:04:59.120><c> most</c><00:04:59.320><c> time</c><00:04:59.720><c> on</c><00:04:59.880><c> it</c><00:05:00.600><c> and</c><00:05:00.960><c> suddenly</c><00:05:01.360><c> you're</c> the most time

I</c> ends up ruining the Creative Cycle and I ends up ruining the Creative Cycle and I think<00:05:09.360><c> this</c><00:05:09.479><c> is</c><00:05:09.720><c> exactly</c><00:05:10.120><c> what's</c><00:05:10.320><c> happening</c> think this is exactly what's happening think this is exactly what's happening with<00:05:10.800><c> these</c><00:05:10.960><c> AI</c><00:05:11.720><c>

really</c><00:05:31.800><c> interesting</c><00:05:32.520><c> argument</c> actually a really interesting argument actually a really interesting argument for<00:05:33.280><c> why</c><00:05:33.440><c> we</c><00:05:33.600><c> need</c><00:05:33.960><c> multiple</c><00:05:34.479><c> AI</c><00:05:35.319><c> providers</c> for why we need multiple AI providers for why we need multiple AI providers because<00:05:36.680><c> by</c><00:05:36.880><c> doing</c><00:05:37.319><c> that</c><00:05:37.880><c> you</c><00:05:38.360><c> end</c><00:05:38.639><c> up</c> because by doing that you end up because

the</c><00:06:33.880><c> models</c><00:06:34.240><c> we</c><00:06:34.360><c> were</c><00:06:34.520><c> using</c><00:06:34.960><c> and</c> our like the models we were using and our like the models we

of</c><00:06:54.400><c> the</c><00:06:54.560><c> results</c> then they look at kind of the results then they look at kind of the results that<00:06:55.039><c> they're</c><00:06:55.319><c>

algorithm</c><00:09:16.200><c> and</c><00:09:16.399><c> so</c> actually going into the algorithm and so actually going into the algorithm and so uh<00:09:17.360><c> it</c><00:09:17.440><c> ends</c><00:09:17.640><c> up</c><00:09:17.839><c> being</c><00:09:18.079><c> the</c><00:09:18.200><c> same</c><00:09:18.480><c> effect</c><00:09:19.320><c> so</c> uh it ends up being the same effect so uh it ends up being the same effect so time<00:09:19.959><c> will</c><00:09:20.120><c> tell</c><00:09:21.040><c> uh</c><00:09:21.320><c> eventually</c><00:09:21.680><c> I</c><00:09:21.760><c>
