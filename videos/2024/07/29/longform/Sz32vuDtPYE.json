pretty much how you you because that's pretty much how you you get<00:03:00.239><c> bigger</c><00:03:00.480><c> models</c><00:03:00.840><c> you</c><00:03:00.959><c> throw</c><00:03:01.159><c> more</c><00:03:01.319><c> data</c><00:03:01.599><c> at</c> get bigger models you throw more data at get bigger models you throw more data at it<00:03:02.000><c> and</c><00:03:02.159><c>

the</c><00:03:13.959><c> answer</c> these large scales I think the answer these large scales I think the answer isn't<00:03:14.519><c> more</c><00:03:14.840><c> data</c><00:03:15.440><c> it's</c><00:03:16.040><c> less</c><00:03:17.040><c> um</c><00:03:17.680><c> and</c><00:03:17.799><c> so</c><00:03:18.040><c> I</c> isn't more data it's less um and so I isn't more data it's less um

Define it and then you have to actually Define it and then you have to calibrate<00:09:09.519><c> it</c><00:09:09.720><c> and</c><00:09:09.839><c> so</c><00:09:10.079><c> one</c><00:09:10.279><c> things</c><00:09:10.640><c> one</c><00:09:10.760><c> of</c> calibrate it and so one things one of calibrate it and so one things one of the<00:09:10.920><c> things</c><00:09:11.079><c> that</c><00:09:11.240><c> we</c><00:09:11.360><c> did</c><00:09:11.560><c> is</c><00:09:11.760><c> we</c><00:09:12.320><c> you</c><00:09:12.440><c> know</c> the things that we did is we you know the
