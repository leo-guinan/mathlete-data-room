talk ideas valuable today I wanted to talk about<00:00:21.160><c> a</c><00:00:21.320><c> concept</c><00:00:21.720><c> I've</c><00:00:21.840><c> been</c><00:00:21.960><c> playing</c><00:00:22.240><c> around</c> about a concept I've been playing around about a concept I've been playing around with<00:00:23.279><c> the</c><00:00:23.480><c> idea</c><00:00:24.199><c> of</c><00:00:24.640><c> latent</c><00:00:25.279><c> demand</c><00:00:26.039><c> so</c> with the idea of latent demand so with the idea of latent demand so basically<00:00:26.760><c> this</c><00:00:26.880><c> is</c><00:00:27.199><c> demand</c><00:00:28.199><c> that</c><00:00:28.400><c> most</c> basically this is demand that most basically this is demand that most people<00:00:28.880><c> don't</c><00:00:29.080><c> see</c><00:00:29.439><c> because</c><00:00:29.599><c> it</c><00:00:29.679><c> doesn't</c> people don't see because it doesn't people don't see because it doesn't actually actually actually exist<00:00:32.800><c> except</c><00:00:33.120><c> it</c><00:00:33.360><c> could</c><00:00:33.960><c> given</c><00:00:34.200><c> the</c><00:00:34.320><c> right</c> exist except it could given the right exist except it could given the right circumstances<00:00:35.719><c> and</c><00:00:35.840><c> the</c><00:00:35.920><c> way</c><00:00:36.079><c> I've</c><00:00:36.239><c> broken</c><00:00:36.520><c> it</c> circumstances and the way I've broken it circumstances and the way I've broken it down<00:00:37.079><c> is</c><00:00:37.239><c> into</c><00:00:37.719><c> the</c><00:00:38.079><c> three</c><00:00:38.640><c> es</c><00:00:39.640><c> of</c><00:00:39.840><c> latent</c> down is into the three es of latent down is into the three es of latent demand<00:00:41.480><c> so</c><00:00:41.680><c> the</c><00:00:41.800><c> first</c><00:00:42.120><c> e</c><00:00:43.039><c> is</c> demand so the first e is demand so the first e is education<00:00:45.559><c> basically</c><00:00:46.360><c> this</c><00:00:46.480><c> is</c><00:00:46.800><c> demand</c><00:00:47.800><c> that</c> education basically this is demand that education basically this is demand that doesn't<00:00:48.920><c> exist</c><00:00:49.640><c> because</c><00:00:50.120><c> the</c><00:00:50.320><c> people</c><00:00:51.000><c> who</c> doesn't exist because the people who doesn't exist because the people who could<00:00:52.239><c> have</c><00:00:52.440><c> the</c><00:00:52.760><c> demand</c><00:00:53.760><c> don't</c><00:00:54.120><c> know</c><00:00:54.399><c> what's</c> could have the demand don't know what's could have the demand don't know what's available<00:00:55.719><c> you're</c><00:00:55.879><c> going</c><00:00:55.960><c> to</c><00:00:56.120><c> see</c><00:00:56.359><c> a</c><00:00:56.520><c> lot</c><00:00:56.719><c> of</c> available you're going to see a lot of available you're going to see a lot of this<00:00:57.680><c> with</c><00:00:58.160><c> AI</c><00:00:58.640><c> products</c><00:00:59.160><c> and</c><00:00:59.280><c> this</c><00:00:59.399><c> is</c> this with AI products and this is this

so</c><00:01:18.360><c> as</c><00:01:18.600><c> part</c><00:01:18.759><c> of</c><00:01:19.000><c> my</c> and understand and so as part of my and understand and so as part of my process<00:01:20.360><c> I</c><00:01:20.520><c> have</c><00:01:20.680><c> to</c><00:01:20.960><c> educate</c><00:01:21.400><c> the</c><00:01:21.560><c> market</c><00:01:22.119><c> on</c> process I have to educate the market on process I have to educate the market on what<00:01:23.079><c> is</c><00:01:23.400><c> actually</c><00:01:24.040><c> possible</c><00:01:24.520><c> now</c><00:01:25.320><c> and</c><00:01:25.439><c> so</c><00:01:25.720><c> I'm</c> what is actually possible now and so I'm what is actually possible now and so I'm creating<00:01:26.439><c> Demand</c><00:01:27.360><c> by</c><00:01:28.040><c> educating</c><00:01:29.040><c> the</c><00:01:29.240><c> people</c> creating Demand by educating the people creating Demand by educating the people who<00:01:29.720><c> could</c><00:01:29.920><c> could</c><00:01:30.200><c> have</c><00:01:30.400><c> the</c><00:01:30.560><c> demand</c><00:01:31.560><c> talking</c> who could could have the demand talking who could could have the demand talking to<00:01:32.040><c> creators</c><00:01:32.479><c> and</c><00:01:32.600><c> I'm</c><00:01:32.759><c> saying</c><00:01:33.159><c> hey</c><00:01:33.720><c> did</c><00:01:33.880><c> you</c> to creators and I'm saying hey did you to creators and I'm saying hey did you know<00:01:34.320><c> that</c><00:01:34.439><c> with</c><00:01:34.640><c> AI</c><00:01:35.399><c> it's</c><00:01:35.640><c> actually</c><00:01:36.119><c> possible</c> know that with AI it's actually possible know that with AI it's actually possible to<00:01:36.720><c> quickly</c><00:01:37.159><c> build</c><00:01:37.439><c> out</c><00:01:37.880><c> the</c><00:01:38.040><c> SAS</c><00:01:38.479><c> product</c> to quickly build out the SAS product to quickly build out the SAS product something<00:01:39.320><c> that</c><00:01:39.439><c> you</c><00:01:39.520><c> can</c><00:01:39.759><c> kind</c><00:01:39.920><c> of</c><00:01:40.520><c> connect</c> something that you can kind of connect something that you can kind of connect that<00:01:41.079><c> to</c><00:01:41.439><c> so</c><00:01:41.600><c> that</c><00:01:41.720><c> they</c><00:01:41.840><c> see</c><00:01:42.079><c> it</c><00:01:42.799><c> and</c><00:01:42.880><c> then</c> that to so that they see it and then that to so that they see it and then once<00:01:43.280><c> they</c><00:01:43.680><c> understand</c><00:01:43.880><c> the</c><00:01:44.040><c> possibilities</c> once they understand the possibilities once they understand the possibilities of<00:01:44.799><c> it</c><00:01:45.320><c> then</c><00:01:45.479><c> all</c><00:01:45.640><c> of</c><00:01:45.759><c> a</c><00:01:45.960><c> sudden</c><00:01:46.960><c> they're</c> of it then all of a sudden they're of it then all of a sudden they're having<00:01:47.560><c> that</c><00:01:47.799><c> demand</c><00:01:48.159><c> for</c><00:01:48.399><c> the</c><00:01:48.719><c> product</c><00:01:49.719><c> they</c> having that demand for the product they having that demand for the product they only<00:01:50.520><c> demand</c><00:01:50.880><c> it</c><00:01:51.280><c> when</c><00:01:51.479><c> they</c><00:01:51.640><c> know</c><00:01:51.840><c> about</c><00:01:52.040><c> it</c> only demand it when they know about it only demand it when they know about it so<00:01:53.320><c> first</c><00:01:53.680><c> e</c><00:01:54.079><c> of</c><00:01:54.200><c> latent</c><00:01:54.600><c> demand</c><00:01:55.119><c> is</c> so first e of latent demand is so first e of latent demand is education<00:01:58.399><c> second</c><00:01:59.119><c> e</c><00:02:00.119><c> of</c><00:02:01.119><c> latent</c><00:02:01.799><c> demand</c><00:02:02.799><c> is</c> education second e of latent demand is education second e of latent demand is exposure<00:02:05.520><c> so</c><00:02:06.520><c> this</c><00:02:06.880><c> is</c><00:02:07.439><c> similar</c> exposure so this is similar exposure so this is similar except<00:02:10.360><c> it's</c><00:02:10.720><c> where</c><00:02:11.480><c> people</c><00:02:11.959><c> don't</c><00:02:12.280><c> know</c><00:02:12.640><c> that</c> except it's where people don't know that except it's where people don't know that something<00:02:13.360><c> exists</c><00:02:14.720><c> and</c><00:02:15.720><c> it's</c><00:02:16.000><c> not</c><00:02:16.239><c> that</c><00:02:16.440><c> they</c> something exists and it's not that they something exists and it's not that they need<00:02:16.879><c> to</c><00:02:17.040><c> learn</c><00:02:17.360><c> about</c><00:02:17.560><c> it</c><00:02:17.760><c> because</c><00:02:18.000><c> it's</c> need to learn about it because it's need to learn about it because it's something<00:02:18.959><c> new</c><00:02:19.959><c> they</c><00:02:20.319><c> just</c><00:02:21.120><c> only</c><00:02:21.959><c> see</c><00:02:22.319><c> the</c> something new they just only see the something new they just only see the existing<00:02:24.400><c> ways</c><00:02:24.800><c> that</c><00:02:25.000><c> something</c><00:02:25.599><c> happens</c><00:02:26.599><c> and</c> existing ways that something happens and existing ways that something happens and so<00:02:28.480><c> in</c><00:02:28.720><c> this</c><00:02:29.000><c> case</c><00:02:29.480><c> it's</c><00:02:30.040><c> really</c><00:02:30.640><c> a</c><00:02:30.800><c> trigger</c><00:02:31.080><c> of</c> so in this case it's really a trigger of so in this case it's really a trigger of like<00:02:31.480><c> mimetic</c> like mimetic like mimetic desire<00:02:33.599><c> um</c><00:02:34.480><c> and</c><00:02:34.640><c> so</c><00:02:35.000><c> when</c><00:02:35.200><c> everybody's</c> desire um and so when everybody's desire um and so when everybody's Friends<00:02:36.000><c> start</c><00:02:36.319><c> doing</c><00:02:36.599><c> something</c><00:02:37.120><c> one</c><00:02:37.560><c> way</c> Friends start doing something one way Friends start doing something one way then<00:02:38.800><c> all</c><00:02:38.959><c> of</c><00:02:39.040><c> a</c><00:02:39.159><c> sudden</c><00:02:39.400><c> they</c><00:02:39.519><c> want</c><00:02:39.640><c> to</c><00:02:39.800><c> start</c> then all of a sudden they want to start then all of a sudden they want to start doing<00:02:40.280><c> it</c><00:02:40.480><c>

that<00:02:53.680><c> I'm</c><00:02:53.800><c> G</c><00:02:54.000><c> do</c><00:02:54.159><c> that</c><00:02:54.599><c> too</c><00:02:55.599><c> and</c><00:02:55.840><c> so</c><00:02:56.760><c> you</c><00:02:56.879><c> know</c> that I'm G do that too and so you know that I'm G do that too and so you know this<00:02:57.280><c> is</c><00:02:57.519><c> really</c><00:02:57.879><c> like</c><00:02:58.000><c> you</c><00:02:58.280><c> basically</c><00:02:58.680><c> see</c> this is really like you basically see this is really like you basically see like<00:02:59.879><c> one</c><00:03:00.159><c> company</c><00:03:01.159><c> discovering</c><00:03:02.080><c> that</c> like one company discovering that like one company discovering that something<00:03:02.599><c> works</c><00:03:03.440><c> communicates</c><00:03:04.200><c> you</c><00:03:04.319><c> know</c><00:03:04.599><c> it</c> something works communicates you know it something works communicates you know it connects<00:03:05.480><c> with</c><00:03:05.640><c> the</c><00:03:06.000><c> user</c><00:03:07.000><c> and</c><00:03:07.360><c> so</c><00:03:07.879><c> companies</c> connects with the user and so companies connects with the user and so companies start<00:03:08.959><c> mimicking</c><00:03:09.519><c> that</c><00:03:09.799><c> and</c><00:03:09.959><c> that's</c><00:03:10.120><c> why</c><00:03:10.239><c> a</c> start mimicking that and that's why a start mimicking that and that's why a lot<00:03:10.400><c> of</c><00:03:10.560><c> social</c><00:03:10.840><c> media</c><00:03:11.360><c> companies</c><00:03:11.760><c> end</c><00:03:11.959><c> up</c> lot of social media companies end up lot of social media companies end up implementing<00:03:13.239><c> the</c><00:03:13.440><c> same</c><00:03:14.239><c> things</c><00:03:14.680><c> over</c><00:03:14.879><c> and</c> implementing the same things over and implementing the same things over and over<00:03:15.319><c> again</c><00:03:16.319><c> um</c><00:03:16.640><c> because</c><00:03:16.879><c> of</c><00:03:17.000><c> kind</c><00:03:17.120><c> of</c><00:03:17.280><c> this</c> over again um because of kind of this over again um because of kind of this exposure<00:03:18.920><c> they</c><00:03:19.080><c> realize</c><00:03:19.560><c> oh</c><00:03:19.799><c> hey</c><00:03:20.560><c> um</c><00:03:21.159><c> this</c><00:03:21.280><c> is</c> exposure they realize oh hey um this is exposure they realize oh hey um this is working<00:03:22.519><c> and</c><00:03:22.599><c> so</c><00:03:22.760><c> this</c><00:03:22.879><c> is</c><00:03:23.000><c> different</c><00:03:23.239><c> from</c> working and so this is different from working and so this is different from the<00:03:23.480><c> education</c><00:03:24.000><c> in</c><00:03:24.120><c> the</c><00:03:24.280><c> sense</c><00:03:24.599><c> that</c><00:03:24.760><c> it's</c><00:03:25.080><c> not</c> the education in the sense that it's not the education in the sense that it's not like<00:03:25.879><c> hey</c><00:03:26.239><c> this</c><00:03:26.360><c> is</c><00:03:26.560><c> definitely</c><00:03:27.000><c> better</c><00:03:27.239><c> for</c> like hey this is definitely better for like hey this is definitely better for you<00:03:27.640><c> and</c><00:03:27.799><c> here's</c><00:03:28.200><c> why</c><00:03:28.879><c> it's</c><00:03:29.159><c> like</c><00:03:29.400><c> hey</c><00:03:29.560><c> this</c> you and here's why it's like hey this you and here's why it's like hey this exists<00:03:30.439><c> and</c><00:03:30.599><c> it's</c><00:03:30.760><c> working</c><00:03:31.000><c> for</c><00:03:31.200><c> other</c><00:03:31.360><c> people</c> exists and it's working for other people exists and it's working for other people and<00:03:31.720><c> now</c><00:03:31.879><c> I</c><00:03:31.959><c> want</c><00:03:32.120><c> it</c><00:03:32.239><c> to</c><00:03:33.200><c> so</c><00:03:33.799><c> it's</c><00:03:34.040><c> kind</c><00:03:34.239><c> of</c><00:03:34.560><c> the</c> and now I want it to so it's kind of the and now I want it to so it's kind of the same<00:03:34.959><c> thing</c><00:03:35.239><c> but</c><00:03:35.480><c> not</c><00:03:35.720><c> quite</c><00:03:36.360><c> this</c><00:03:36.480><c> brings</c><00:03:36.760><c> us</c> same thing but not quite this brings us same thing but not quite this brings us to<00:03:37.080><c> the</c><00:03:37.200><c> 30</c><00:03:38.120><c> which</c><00:03:38.280><c> is</c><00:03:39.080><c> efficiency</c><00:03:40.080><c> so</c><00:03:41.000><c> this</c> to the 30 which is efficiency so this to the 30 which is efficiency so this relates<00:03:41.560><c> to</c><00:03:41.680><c> a</c><00:03:41.920><c> principle</c><00:03:42.920><c> uh</c><00:03:43.040><c> that</c><00:03:43.159><c> you</c><00:03:43.280><c> may</c> relates to a principle uh that you may relates to a principle uh that you may or<00:03:43.560><c> may</c><00:03:43.720><c> not</c><00:03:43.840><c> have</c><00:03:43.959><c> heard</c><00:03:44.159><c> of</c><00:03:44.480><c> called</c><00:03:44.720><c> javon's</c> or may not have heard of called javon's or may not have heard of called javon's Paradox<00:03:46.680><c> and</c><00:03:47.200><c> basically</c><00:03:47.760><c> the</c><00:03:47.959><c> idea</c><00:03:48.400><c> is</c><00:03:48.640><c> that</c> Paradox and basically the idea is that Paradox and basically the idea is that as<00:03:49.200><c> something</c><00:03:49.640><c> becomes</c><00:03:50.360><c> cheaper</c><00:03:50.920><c> to</c> as something becomes cheaper to as something becomes cheaper to produce<00:03:52.959><c> consumption</c><00:03:53.560><c> actually</c><00:03:54.000><c> starts</c><00:03:54.280><c> to</c> produce consumption actually starts to produce consumption actually starts to go<00:03:54.599><c> up</c><00:03:55.159><c> and</c><00:03:55.319><c> this</c><00:03:55.400><c> is</c><00:03:55.680><c> really</c><00:03:55.959><c> seen</c><00:03:56.599><c> in</c><00:03:57.040><c> the</c> go up and this is really seen in the go up and this is really seen in the energy<00:03:57.840><c> space</c><00:03:58.680><c> basically</c><00:03:59.239><c> as</c><00:03:59.360><c> it</c><00:03:59.799><c> becomes</c> energy space basically as it becomes energy space basically as it becomes easier<00:04:00.599><c> and</c><00:04:00.760><c> easier</c><00:04:01.120><c> to</c><00:04:01.560><c> consume</c><00:04:02.680><c> electricity</c> easier and easier to consume electricity easier and easier to consume electricity we<00:04:03.840><c> start</c><00:04:04.120><c> consuming</c><00:04:04.680><c> a</c><00:04:04.799><c> lot</c><00:04:05.000><c> more</c><00:04:05.200><c> of</c><00:04:05.360><c> it</c><00:04:05.720><c> from</c> we start consuming a lot more of it from we start consuming a lot more of it from these<00:04:06.480><c> efficiency</c><00:04:07.040><c> gains</c><00:04:07.920><c> suddenly</c><00:04:08.680><c> we're</c> these efficiency gains suddenly we're these efficiency gains suddenly we're using<00:04:09.239><c> it</c><00:04:09.360><c> for</c><00:04:09.519><c> more</c><00:04:09.680><c> and</c><00:04:09.799><c> more</c><00:04:10.040><c> things</c> using it for more and more things using it for more and more things because<00:04:10.720><c> we</c><00:04:10.840><c> see</c><00:04:11.280><c> what's</c><00:04:11.560><c> possible</c><00:04:11.959><c> now</c><00:04:12.959><c> um</c> because we see what's possible now um because we see what's possible now um you<00:04:13.680><c> know</c><00:04:13.920><c> cost</c><00:04:14.200><c> goes</c><00:04:14.519><c> down</c><00:04:14.920><c> it</c><00:04:15.440><c> becomes</c><00:04:16.440><c> uh</c> you know cost goes down it becomes uh you know cost goes down it becomes uh something<00:04:16.880><c> that</c><00:04:17.079><c> other</c><00:04:17.280><c> people</c><00:04:17.519><c> can</c><00:04:18.040><c> use</c><00:04:19.040><c> um</c> something that other people can use um something that other people can use um much<00:04:19.680><c> more</c><00:04:19.919><c> easily</c><00:04:20.320><c> you</c><00:04:20.440><c> don't</c><00:04:20.720><c> have</c><00:04:20.840><c> to</c><00:04:21.040><c> have</c> much more easily you don't have to have much more easily you don't have to have nearly<00:04:21.519><c> as</c><00:04:21.639><c> many</c><00:04:21.919><c> resources</c><00:04:22.440><c> so</c><00:04:22.639><c> it</c><00:04:22.759><c> broadens</c> nearly as many resources so it broadens nearly as many resources so it broadens the<00:04:23.280><c> pool</c><00:04:23.560><c> of</c><00:04:23.759><c> who</c><00:04:23.919><c> can</c><00:04:24.120><c> actually</c><00:04:24.479><c> have</c><00:04:24.759><c> access</c> the pool of who can actually have access the pool of who can actually have access to<00:04:25.320><c> it</c><00:04:26.320><c> um</c><00:04:26.560><c> and</c><00:04:26.759><c> basically</c><00:04:27.120><c> you</c><00:04:27.240><c> know</c><00:04:27.400><c> lower</c> to it um and basically you know lower to it um and basically you know lower prices<00:04:28.160><c> result</c><00:04:28.560><c> in</c><00:04:28.919><c> higher</c><00:04:29.240><c> demand</c> prices result in higher demand prices result in higher demand and<00:04:30.919><c> we're</c><00:04:31.120><c> seeing</c><00:04:31.520><c> this</c><00:04:31.840><c> again</c><00:04:32.039><c> kind</c><00:04:32.160><c> of</c><00:04:32.280><c> in</c> and we're seeing this again kind of in and we're seeing this again kind of in the<00:04:32.520><c> AI</c><00:04:32.880><c> space</c><00:04:33.280><c> right</c><00:04:33.440><c> now</c><00:04:34.400><c> where</c><00:04:35.400><c> models</c><00:04:35.880><c> are</c> the AI space right now where models are the AI space right now where models are becoming<00:04:36.400><c> cheaper</c><00:04:36.680><c> and</c><00:04:36.800><c> cheaper</c><00:04:37.080><c> to</c><00:04:37.240><c> use</c><00:04:37.840><c> and</c> becoming cheaper and cheaper to use and becoming cheaper and cheaper to use and so<00:04:38.479><c> as</c><00:04:38.720><c> they</c><00:04:38.880><c> become</c><00:04:39.120><c> cheaper</c><00:04:39.400><c> and</c><00:04:39.479><c> cheaper</c><00:04:39.720><c> to</c> so as they become cheaper and cheaper to so as they become cheaper and cheaper to use<00:04:40.120><c> more</c><00:04:40.240><c> and</c><00:04:40.360><c> more</c><00:04:40.520><c> people</c><00:04:40.680><c> are</c><00:04:40.800><c> using</c><00:04:41.080><c> them</c> use more and more people are using them use more and more people are using them to<00:04:41.360><c> do</c><00:04:41.520><c> more</c><00:04:41.680><c> and</c><00:04:41.800><c> more</c><00:04:42.479><c>

is</c><00:04:44.520><c> going</c><00:04:44.680><c> to</c><00:04:44.880><c> zero</c> intelligence is going to zero intelligence is going to zero everything's<00:04:46.199><c> becoming</c> everything's becoming everything's becoming intelligent<00:04:48.240><c> that's</c><00:04:48.400><c> kind</c><00:04:48.520><c> of</c><00:04:48.600><c> how</c><00:04:48.759><c> that</c> intelligent that's kind of how that intelligent that's kind of how that works<00:04:50.199><c> and</c><00:04:50.560><c> so</c><00:04:51.560><c> it</c><00:04:51.680><c> becomes</c><00:04:51.960><c> a</c><00:04:52.120><c>

to</c> now that it's become cost effective to now that it's become cost effective to do<00:04:57.240><c> so</c><00:04:58.240><c> um</c><00:04:58.759><c> and</c><00:04:58.919><c>
