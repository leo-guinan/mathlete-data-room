use</c><00:02:19.040><c> chat</c><00:02:19.319><c> GPT</c> simply just letting people use chat GPT simply just letting people use chat GPT or or or clad<00:02:22.120><c> and</c><00:02:23.120><c> maybe</c><00:02:23.599><c> the</c><00:02:23.879><c> faster</c><00:02:24.319><c> route</c><00:02:24.920><c> is</c><00:02:25.680><c> to</c> clad and maybe the faster route is to clad and maybe the faster route is to teach<00:02:27.040><c> people</c><00:02:27.239><c> how</c><00:02:27.319><c> to</c><00:02:27.440><c> use</c><00:02:27.599><c> it</c><00:02:27.760><c> more</c> teach people how to use it more teach people how to use it more effectively<00:02:29.640><c> and</c><00:02:30.000><c> so</c><00:02:30.400><c> I</c><00:02:30.560><c> actually</c><00:02:30.720><c> started</c> effectively and so I actually started effectively and so I actually started putting<00:02:31.280><c> together</c><00:02:31.440><c> a</c><00:02:31.560><c> course</c><00:02:31.840><c> on</c><00:02:32.200><c>

really</c><00:03:59.959><c> simple</c><00:04:00.319><c> here</c><00:04:01.120><c> um</c><00:04:01.319><c> so</c><00:04:01.439><c> we're</c> something really simple here um so we're something really simple here um so we're actually<00:04:01.720><c> going</c><00:04:01.799><c> to</c><00:04:02.280><c> print</c><00:04:03.280><c> uh</c><00:04:03.439><c> I</c><00:04:03.519><c> don't</c><00:04:03.640><c> know</c> actually going to print uh I don't know actually going to print uh I don't know if<00:04:03.879><c> that</c><00:04:03.959><c> showed</c><00:04:04.239><c>

basically</c><00:04:06.400><c> I'm</c><00:04:06.640><c> printing</c><00:04:07.360><c> except</c> but basically I'm printing except but basically I'm printing except instead<00:04:07.920><c> of</c><00:04:08.000><c> going</c><00:04:08.159><c> to</c><00:04:08.239><c> a</c><00:04:08.319><c> printer</c><00:04:08.640><c> I'm</c><00:04:08.760><c> saving</c> instead of going to a printer I'm saving instead of going to a printer I'm saving it<00:04:09.159><c> to</c><00:04:09.280><c> a</c> it to a it to a PDF<00:04:10.920><c> um</c><00:04:11.599><c> this</c><00:04:11.760><c> is</c><00:04:12.159><c> how</c> PDF um this is how PDF um this is how I<00:04:14.560><c> uh</c><00:04:15.000><c> save</c><00:04:15.319><c> websites</c><00:04:16.000><c> that</c><00:04:16.239><c> I</c><00:04:16.400><c> want</c><00:04:16.959><c> to</c><00:04:17.959><c> use</c> I uh save websites that I want to use I uh save websites that I want to use and<00:04:19.079><c>
