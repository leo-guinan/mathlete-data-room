different</c> people end up with very different people end up with very different trajectories<00:02:02.759><c> and</c><00:02:03.119><c> this</c><00:02:03.240><c> is</c><00:02:03.399><c> one</c><00:02:03.520><c> of</c><00:02:03.680><c> those</c> trajectories and this is one of those trajectories and this is one of those stories<00:02:04.240><c> that</c><00:02:04.360><c> could</c><00:02:04.520><c> very</c><00:02:04.719><c> much</c><00:02:04.880><c> go</c><00:02:05.119><c> the</c> stories that could very much go the stories that could very much go the other<00:02:05.560><c> way</c><00:02:06.439><c> if</c><00:02:07.360><c> you</c><00:02:07.520><c> know</c><00:02:08.399><c> he'</c><00:02:08.720><c> take</c><00:02:08.840><c> a</c><00:02:09.039><c> stock</c> other way if you know he' take a stock other way if you know he' take a stock and<00:02:09.599><c> then</c><00:02:09.879><c> the</c><00:02:10.039><c> company</c><00:02:10.399><c> went</c><00:02:10.599><c> out</c><00:02:10.720><c> of</c> and then the company went out of and then the company went out of business<00:02:11.280><c> instead</c><00:02:11.520><c> of</c><00:02:11.680><c> sold</c><00:02:12.200><c> right</c><00:02:13.080><c> suddenly</c> business instead of sold right suddenly business instead of sold right suddenly there<00:02:13.640><c> are</c><00:02:13.959><c> these</c><00:02:14.840><c> much</c><00:02:15.160><c> different</c> there are these much different there are these much different outcomes<00:02:17.280><c> and</c><00:02:17.879><c> so</c><00:02:18.879><c> uh</c><00:02:19.000><c> this</c><00:02:19.120><c> is</c><00:02:19.280><c> nothing</c> outcomes and so uh this is nothing outcomes and so uh this is nothing related<00:02:19.840><c> to</c><00:02:19.959><c> nonprofits</c><00:02:20.560><c> directly</c><00:02:21.080><c> but</c><00:02:21.200><c> it's</c> related to nonprofits directly but it's related to nonprofits directly but it's this<00:02:21.599><c> idea</c><00:02:22.000><c> that</c><00:02:22.200><c> people</c><00:02:22.480><c> don't</c><00:02:22.760><c> actually</c> this idea that people
