hey</c><00:02:51.440><c> what</c> him a message again and I said hey what him a message again and I said hey what do<00:02:51.640><c> you</c><00:02:51.760><c> think</c><00:02:51.879><c> of</c> do you think of do you think of this<00:02:54.040><c> um</c><00:02:54.640><c> and</c><00:02:54.760><c> he</c><00:02:54.879><c> was</c><00:02:55.080><c> like</c><00:02:55.440><c> well</c><00:02:55.599><c> this</c><00:02:55.720><c> was</c> this um and he was like well this was this um and he was like well this was really<00:02:56.200><c> obviously</c><00:02:56.560><c> written</c><00:02:56.840><c> with</c><00:02:57.000><c> AI</c><00:02:57.440><c> like</c> really obviously written with AI like really obviously written with AI like you<00:02:57.640><c> could</c><00:02:57.760><c> tell</c><00:02:57.959><c> by</c><00:02:58.159><c> this</c><00:02:58.319><c> piece</c><00:02:58.560><c> this</c><00:02:58.760><c> piece</c> you could tell by this piece this piece you could tell by this piece this piece and<00:02:59.080><c> this</c><00:02:59.280><c> piece</c><00:03:00.080><c> here's</c><00:03:00.319><c> how</c><00:03:00.440><c> I</c><00:03:00.519><c> would</c> and this piece here's how I would and this piece here's how I would rewrite<00:03:01.000><c> it</c><00:03:01.080><c> to</c><00:03:01.239><c> make</c><00:03:01.400><c> it</c> rewrite it to make it rewrite it to make it better<00:03:03.200><c> and</c><00:03:03.440><c> so</c><00:03:03.879><c> because</c><00:03:04.120><c> I</c><00:03:04.239><c> handed</c><00:03:04.480><c> him</c> better and so because I handed him better and so because I handed him something<00:03:05.120><c> concrete</c><00:03:06.120><c> he</c><00:03:06.280><c> was</c><00:03:06.480><c> able</c><00:03:06.720><c> to</c><00:03:06.959><c> make</c> something concrete he was able to make something concrete he was able to make very<00:03:07.799><c> specific</c><00:03:08.720><c> changes</c><00:03:09.720><c> to</c><00:03:10.640><c> what</c><00:03:10.799><c> I</c><00:03:10.959><c> had</c><00:03:11.120><c> to</c> very specific changes to what I had to very specific changes to what I had to say<00:03:12.799><c> and</c><00:03:13.920><c> suddenly</c><00:03:14.920><c> it's</c><00:03:15.239><c> like</c><00:03:15.599><c> okay</c><00:03:15.879><c> I've</c><00:03:16.040><c> got</c> say and suddenly it's like okay I've got say and suddenly it's like okay I've got this<00:03:16.440><c> great</c><00:03:16.720><c> template</c><00:03:17.720><c> but</c><00:03:17.840><c> here's</c><00:03:18.040><c> the</c><00:03:18.159><c> real</c> this great template but here's the real this great template but here's the real trick<00:03:18.680><c> so</c><00:03:18.879><c> I</c><00:03:18.920><c> was</c><00:03:19.040><c> able</c><00:03:19.239><c> to</c><00:03:19.400><c> get</c><00:03:19.799><c> like</c><00:03:20.440><c> make</c><00:03:20.680><c> the</c> trick so I was able to get like make the trick so I was able to get like make the feedback<00:03:21.560><c> loop</c><00:03:22.040><c> faster</c><00:03:22.760><c> right</c><00:03:23.760><c> I'm</c><00:03:24.640><c> getting</c> feedback loop faster right I'm getting feedback loop faster right I'm getting feedback<00:03:26.319><c> I'm</c><00:03:26.519><c> implementing</c><00:03:27.000><c> it</c><00:03:27.239><c> immediately</c> feedback I'm implementing it immediately feedback I'm implementing it immediately I'm<00:03:28.439><c> sending</c><00:03:28.760><c> it</c><00:03:29.000><c> back</c><00:03:29.360><c> getting</c><00:03:29.920><c> feedback</c> I'm sending it back getting feedback I'm sending it back getting feedback immediately<00:03:31.840><c> okay</c><00:03:32.120><c> great</c><00:03:32.959><c> now</c><00:03:33.239><c> I've</c><00:03:33.439><c> got</c> immediately okay great now I've got immediately okay great now I've got something something something worthwhile<00:03:36.519><c> now</c><00:03:36.720><c> the</c><00:03:36.879><c> trick</c><00:03:37.319><c> is</c><00:03:38.319><c> okay</c><00:03:38.959><c> now</c> worthwhile now the trick is okay now worthwhile now the trick is okay now that<00:03:39.280><c> I've</c><00:03:39.480><c> got</c><00:03:39.680><c> that</c> that I've got that that I've got that feedback<00:03:42.120><c> and</c><00:03:42.239><c> I</c><00:03:42.400><c> know</c><00:03:42.640><c> what</c><00:03:42.799><c> I'm</c><00:03:43.000><c> looking</c> feedback and I know what I'm looking feedback and I know what I'm looking for<00:03:44.879><c> I</c><00:03:45.080><c> actually</c> for I actually for I actually pasted<00:03:46.959><c> both</c><00:03:47.280><c> the</c><00:03:47.439><c> original</c><00:03:47.959><c> version</c><00:03:48.840><c> that</c> pasted both the original version that pasted both the original version that Claude<00:03:49.319><c> had</c><00:03:49.799><c> written</c><00:03:50.840><c> and</c><00:03:51.840><c> the</c><00:03:52.159><c> the</c><00:03:52.280><c> feedback</c> Claude had written and the the feedback Claude had written and the the feedback and<00:03:53.239><c> I</c><00:03:53.360><c> said</c><00:03:53.920><c> you</c><00:03:54.040><c> know</c><00:03:54.239><c> rewrite</c><00:03:54.720><c> this</c><00:03:54.840><c> to</c> and I said you know rewrite this to and I said you know rewrite this to include<00:03:55.360><c> this</c> include this include this feedback<00:03:57.920><c> but</c><00:03:58.200><c> then</c><00:03:58.720><c> the</c><00:03:58.879><c> real</c><00:03:59.120><c> trick</c><00:03:59.799><c> is</c><00:03:59.959><c> I</c> feedback but then the real trick is I feedback but then the real trick is I said<00:04:01.040><c> now</c><00:04:01.280><c> make</c><00:04:01.439><c> a</c><00:04:01.680><c> style</c><00:04:02.120><c> guide</c><00:04:02.439><c> for</c><00:04:02.680><c> me</c><00:04:03.680><c> to</c> said now make a style guide for me to said now make a style guide for me to make<00:04:04.480><c> sure</c><00:04:04.799><c> that</c><00:04:04.959><c> I</c><00:04:05.040><c> can</c><00:04:05.239><c> incorporate</c><00:04:05.879><c> that</c> make sure that I can incorporate that make sure that I can incorporate that feedback<00:04:07.599><c> at</c><00:04:08.000><c> any</c><00:04:08.239><c> point</c><00:04:08.439><c> in</c> feedback at any point in feedback at any point in time<00:04:10.640><c> and</c><00:04:10.840><c> so</c><00:04:11.519><c> suddenly</c><00:04:11.920><c> I've</c><00:04:12.040><c> got</c><00:04:12.200><c> this</c><00:04:12.360><c> style</c> time and so suddenly I've got this style time and so suddenly I've got this style guide<00:04:13.079><c> right</c><00:04:13.879><c> and</c><00:04:14.120><c> now</c><00:04:14.480><c> I</c><00:04:14.560><c> can</c><00:04:14.720><c> go</c><00:04:14.920><c> into</c><00:04:15.920><c> Claud</c> guide right and now I can go into Claud guide right and now I can go into Claud projects<00:04:18.160><c> and</c><00:04:18.799><c> add</c><00:04:19.040><c> this</c><00:04:19.199><c> style</c><00:04:19.639><c> guide</c><00:04:20.040><c> as</c><00:04:20.160><c> a</c> projects and add this style guide as a projects and add this style guide as a piece<00:04:20.519><c> of</c><00:04:20.720><c>
