that</c><00:03:47.680><c> because</c><00:03:47.879><c> there's</c> actually fewer than that because there's actually fewer than that because there's a<00:03:48.200><c> bunch</c><00:03:48.480><c> that</c><00:03:48.599><c> have</c><00:03:48.720><c> been</c><00:03:48.959><c> lost</c><00:03:49.360><c> to</c><00:03:50.360><c> all</c><00:03:50.599><c> sorts</c> a bunch that have been lost to all

something</c> years um but when you look at something years um but when you look at something like<00:03:58.840><c> Dogecoin</c><00:03:59.439><c> Doge</c><00:03:59.920><c> coin</c><00:04:00.200><c> actually</c><00:04:00.680><c> has</c><00:04:01.680><c> uh</c> like Dogecoin Doge coin actually has uh like Dogecoin Doge coin actually has uh an<00:04:02.760><c> infinite</c><00:04:03.200><c> Supply</c><00:04:03.720><c> so</c><00:04:03.920><c> they</c><00:04:04.159><c> keep</c><00:04:04.360><c> minting</c> an infinite Supply so they keep minting an infinite Supply so they keep minting more<00:04:06.760><c> and</c><00:04:07.760><c> so</c><00:04:07.920><c> that</c><00:04:08.079><c> makes</c><00:04:08.239><c> it</c><00:04:08.439><c> actually</c><00:04:08.680><c> very</c> more and so that makes it actually very more and so that makes it actually very hard<00:04:09.079><c> to</c><00:04:09.439><c> price</c><00:04:10.519><c> because</c><00:04:11.519><c> you</c><00:04:11.680><c> know</c><00:04:12.280><c> there's</c> hard to price because you know there's hard to price because you know there's just<00:04:12.640><c> going</c><00:04:12.720><c> to</c><00:04:12.840><c> be</c><00:04:13.000><c> this</c><00:04:13.280><c> constantly</c> just going to be this constantly just going to be this constantly increasing increasing increasing Supply Supply Supply and<00:04:18.199><c> so</c><00:04:18.400><c> you</c><00:04:18.519><c> don't</c><00:04:18.720><c> really</c><00:04:19.000><c> know</c><00:04:19.600><c> what</c><00:04:20.400><c> the</c><00:04:21.400><c> uh</c> and so you don't really know what the uh and so you don't really know what the uh value<00:04:22.280><c> is</c><00:04:22.520><c> actually</c><00:04:22.800><c> going</c><00:04:23.000><c> to</c><00:04:23.160><c> be</c><00:04:23.320><c> at</c><00:04:23.440><c> any</c> value is actually going to be at any value is actually going to be at any

so</c><00:04:29.840><c> you</c> everybody can have them um and so you everybody can have them um and so you have<00:04:30.240><c> to</c><00:04:31.280><c> really</c><00:04:32.280><c> increase</c><00:04:32.840><c> demand</c><00:04:33.320><c> at</c><00:04:33.440><c> least</c> have to really increase demand at least have to really increase demand at least as<00:04:34.039><c>
