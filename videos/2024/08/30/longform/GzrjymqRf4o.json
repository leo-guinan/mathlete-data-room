all</c><00:00:49.039><c> flux</c><00:00:49.960><c> is</c><00:00:50.440><c> a</c><00:00:50.719><c> new</c> lot too so first of all flux is a new lot too so first of all flux is a new open-source<00:00:52.000><c> image</c><00:00:52.399><c> generation</c> open-source image generation open-source image generation model<00:00:54.480><c> and</c><00:00:55.280><c> they've</c><00:00:55.520><c> actually</c><00:00:55.680><c> got</c><00:00:55.840><c> three</c> model and they've actually got three model and they've actually got three different<00:00:56.239><c> levels</c><00:00:56.559><c> they've</c><00:00:56.760><c> got</c><00:00:57.199><c> flux</c><00:00:57.760><c> Pro</c> different levels they've got flux Pro different levels they've got flux Pro which<00:00:59.239><c> is</c><00:01:00.239><c> tied</c><00:01:00.559><c> into</c><00:01:01.160><c> like</c><00:01:01.640><c> uh</c><00:01:01.879><c> a</c><00:01:02.000><c> service</c> which is tied

to</c><00:01:03.600><c> like</c><00:01:03.719><c> a</c> they've got which is similar to like a they've got which is similar to like a mid<00:01:04.360><c> Journey</c><00:01:05.360><c> um</c><00:01:05.680><c> then</c><00:01:05.880><c> they</c><00:01:06.119><c> have</c><00:01:06.520><c> flux</c><00:01:07.200><c> Dev</c> mid Journey um then they have flux Dev mid Journey um then they have flux Dev which<00:01:08.119><c> is</c><00:01:08.320><c> kind</c><00:01:08.439><c> of</c><00:01:08.799><c> the</c><00:01:09.799><c> uh</c><00:01:10.400><c> bigger</c><00:01:10.880><c> more</c> which is kind of the uh bigger more which is kind of the uh bigger more full-featured<00:01:11.840><c> open-</c><00:01:12.560><c> Source</c><00:01:12.920><c> model</c><00:01:13.320><c> that</c> full-featured open- Source model that full-featured open- Source model that you<00:01:13.640><c> can</c><00:01:14.119><c> do</c><00:01:14.400><c> all</c><00:01:14.560><c> sorts</c><00:01:14.840><c> of</c><00:01:15.159><c> really</c><00:01:15.600><c> cool</c><00:01:16.600><c> uh</c> you can do all sorts of really cool uh you can do all sorts of really cool uh modifications<00:01:17.439><c>

maybe a majority of the<00:02:00.840><c> time</c><00:02:01.240><c> not</c><00:02:01.520><c> it's</c><00:02:01.680><c> definitely</c><00:02:02.000><c> not</c><00:02:02.280><c> 100%</c> the time not it's definitely not 100% the time not it's definitely not 100% accurate<00:02:03.600><c> I've</c><00:02:03.799><c> managed</c><00:02:04.200><c> to</c><00:02:04.439><c> get</c><00:02:04.840><c> all</c><00:02:05.000><c> sorts</c> accurate I've managed to get all sorts accurate I've managed to get all sorts of<00:02:05.520><c> like</c><00:02:05.719><c> weird</c><00:02:06.039><c>

you</c><00:04:22.960><c> can</c><00:04:23.240><c> actually</c><00:04:23.759><c> like</c> happening and then you can actually like happening and then you can actually like run<00:04:25.080><c> the</c><00:04:25.280><c> model</c><00:04:25.759><c> against</c><00:04:26.040><c> a</c><00:04:26.360><c> prompt</c><00:04:27.560><c> and</c><00:04:28.560><c> see</c> run the model against a prompt and

you</c><00:07:38.680><c> might</c><00:07:38.919><c> be</c><00:07:39.120><c> better</c><00:07:39.360><c> off</c><00:07:39.599><c> just</c> that so you might be better off just that so you might be

just<00:07:47.080><c> really</c><00:07:47.360><c> start</c><00:07:47.680><c> generating</c><00:07:48.280><c> high</c> just really start generating high just really start generating high quality<00:07:48.840><c> images</c><00:07:49.360><c> and</c><00:07:49.759><c> honestly</c><00:07:50.759><c> it</c><00:07:50.919><c> takes</c><00:07:51.159><c> a</c> quality images and honestly it

lot</c><00:07:52.960><c> of</c><00:07:53.039><c> system</c> lot longer um it takes a lot of system lot longer um it takes a lot of system resources<00:07:54.879><c> eventually</c><00:07:55.520><c> I</c><00:07:55.639><c> may</c><00:07:56.080><c> deploy</c><00:07:56.479><c> my</c><00:07:56.599><c> own</c> resources eventually I may deploy my own resources eventually I may deploy my own
