**Description**:
The economy is a game and this year, weâ€™re speedrunning it. Here is my bold plan to reshape the economy by proving that people are the most undervalued asset. Through the lens of risk, AI acceleration, and human potential, Iâ€™m taking on the traditional rules of finance and proposing a ground-breaking idea: human insurance.

This isnâ€™t just a theoryâ€”itâ€™s a plan in action. If youâ€™ve ever wondered how to tackle big problems like wage suppression, financial inequality, or AIâ€™s societal impact, this episode is for you.

people</c> and what I've realized is that people and what I've realized is that people need<00:00:38.239><c> more</c><00:00:38.640><c> Security</c><00:00:39.280><c> in</c><00:00:39.440><c>

world</c><00:00:55.920><c> are</c><00:00:56.120><c> simply</c> understandings of the world are simply understandings of the world are simply wrong<00:00:57.960><c> and</c><00:00:58.960><c> I've</c><00:00:59.160><c> talked</c><00:00:59.480><c> before</c><00:01:00.000><c> about</c><00:01:00.160><c> how</c> wrong and I've talked before about how wrong and I've talked before about how people<00:01:00.760><c> are</c><00:01:01.199><c> the</c><00:01:01.359><c> most</c><00:01:01.559><c> undervalued</c><00:01:02.320><c> asset</c> people are the most undervalued asset people are the most undervalued asset and<00:01:03.719><c> I</c><00:01:04.040><c> realized</c><00:01:05.240><c> that</c><00:01:06.240><c> the</c><00:01:07.040><c> rules</c><00:01:07.360><c> of</c><00:01:07.520><c> the</c> and I realized that the rules of the and I realized that the rules of the game<00:01:07.840><c> that</c><00:01:08.040><c> come</c><00:01:08.159><c> in</c><00:01:08.400><c> here</c><00:01:08.680><c> are</c><00:01:08.960><c> basically</c> game that come in here are basically game that come in here are basically around<00:01:09.880><c> how</c><00:01:10.119><c> risk</c><00:01:10.400><c> is</c><00:01:10.600><c> calculated</c><00:01:11.479><c> and</c><00:01:11.680><c> so</c><00:01:12.479><c> the</c> around how risk is calculated and so the around how risk is calculated and so the economy<00:01:13.280><c> is</c><00:01:13.400><c> a</c><00:01:13.759><c> big</c><00:01:14.759><c> gambling</c><00:01:15.360><c> game</c><00:01:16.080><c> where</c> economy is a big gambling game where economy is a big gambling game where everybody's<00:01:17.000><c> trying</c> everybody's trying everybody's trying to<00:01:19.600><c> find</c><00:01:20.079><c> risk</c><00:01:20.720><c> that</c><00:01:20.960><c> is</c><00:01:21.960><c> cheaper</c><00:01:22.439><c> than</c><00:01:22.640><c> it</c> to find risk that is cheaper than it to find risk that is cheaper than it should<00:01:23.240><c> be</c><00:01:24.240><c> um</c><00:01:24.360><c> for</c><00:01:24.600><c> the</c><00:01:24.720><c> level</c><00:01:24.920><c> of</c><00:01:25.119><c> risk</c><00:01:25.600><c> and</c> should be um for the level of risk and should be um for the level of risk and so<00:01:26.079><c> you</c><00:01:26.200><c> do</c><00:01:26.400><c> this</c><00:01:26.520><c> a</c><00:01:26.640><c> couple</c><00:01:26.880><c> ways</c><00:01:27.159><c> you</c><00:01:27.360><c> either</c> so you do this a couple ways you either so you do this a couple ways you either look<00:01:27.880><c> at</c><00:01:28.000><c> a</c><00:01:28.200><c> risk</c><00:01:28.439><c> and</c><00:01:28.759><c> say</c><00:01:29.759><c> um</c><00:01:30.240><c> you</c><00:01:30.360><c> know</c><00:01:30.600><c> the</c> look at a risk and say um you know the look at a risk and say um you know the price<00:01:31.079><c> on</c><00:01:31.640><c> this</c><00:01:32.640><c> uh</c><00:01:32.920><c> isn't</c><00:01:33.320><c> as</c><00:01:33.479><c> risky</c><00:01:34.799><c> as</c><00:01:35.799><c> the</c> price on this uh isn't as risky as the price on this uh isn't as risky as the rest<00:01:36.040><c> of</c><00:01:36.119><c> the</c><00:01:36.240><c> world</c><00:01:36.479><c> thinks</c><00:01:37.000><c> and</c><00:01:37.159><c> so</c><00:01:37.600><c> I'm</c> rest of the world thinks and so I'm rest of the world thinks and so I'm going<00:01:37.880><c> to</c><00:01:38.000><c> go</c><00:01:38.119><c> big</c><00:01:38.320><c> on</c><00:01:38.520><c> that</c><00:01:38.759><c> because</c><00:01:38.960><c> I</c><00:01:39.040><c> think</c> going to go big on that because I think going to go big on that because I think it's<00:01:39.280><c> a</c><00:01:39.399><c> sure</c><00:01:39.680><c> thing</c><00:01:40.560><c> or</c><00:01:41.360><c> the</c><00:01:41.479><c> flip</c><00:01:41.799><c> side</c><00:01:41.960><c> of</c> it's a sure thing or the flip side of it's a sure thing or the flip side of that<00:01:42.520><c> is</c><00:01:43.200><c> oh</c><00:01:44.200><c> this</c><00:01:44.640><c> is</c><00:01:45.040><c> a</c><00:01:45.200><c> lot</c><00:01:45.479><c> riskier</c><00:01:46.119><c> than</c> that is oh this is a lot riskier than that is oh this is a lot riskier than people<00:01:46.600><c> think</c><00:01:47.200><c> and</c><00:01:47.439><c> so</c><00:01:48.040><c> I'm</c><00:01:48.200><c> going</c><00:01:48.280><c> to</c><00:01:48.439><c> stay</c> people think and so I'm going to stay people think and so I'm going to stay away<00:01:49.240><c> while</c><00:01:49.640><c> everybody's</c><00:01:50.079><c> funneling</c><00:01:50.520><c> money</c> away while everybody's funneling money away while everybody's funneling money into<00:01:51.119><c> this</c><00:01:51.640><c> and</c><00:01:52.200><c> in</c><00:01:52.360><c> a</c><00:01:52.439><c> lot</c><00:01:52.560><c> of</c><00:01:52.680><c> ways</c><00:01:52.960><c> that</c> into this and in a lot of ways that into this and in a lot of ways that second<00:01:53.439><c> one</c><00:01:53.640><c> has</c><00:01:53.880><c> been</c><00:01:54.079><c> my</c><00:01:54.320><c> approach</c><00:01:54.640><c> to</c> second one has been my approach to second one has been my approach to crypto<00:01:55.600><c> because</c><00:01:56.520><c> I've</c><00:01:56.680><c> always</c><00:01:56.840><c> been</c><00:01:57.079><c> looking</c> crypto because I've always been looking crypto because I've always been looking at<00:01:58.159><c> this</c><00:01:58.479><c> concept</c><00:01:58.880><c> of</c><00:01:59.079><c> like</c><00:01:59.280><c> oh</c><00:01:59.439><c> it's</c><00:01:59.560><c> a</c><00:01:59.920><c> store</c> at this concept of like oh it's a store at this concept of like oh it's a store of<00:02:00.320><c> value</c><00:02:00.880><c> and</c><00:02:01.000><c> I</c><00:02:01.119><c> was</c><00:02:01.320><c> like</c><00:02:02.079><c> what</c><00:02:02.240><c> does</c><00:02:02.399><c> that</c> of value and I was like what does that of value and I was like what does that actually<00:02:03.159><c> mean</c><00:02:04.159><c> and</c><00:02:04.479><c> I</c><00:02:04.600><c> realized</c><00:02:05.039><c> you</c><00:02:05.200><c> can't</c> actually mean and I realized you can't actually mean and I realized you can't actually<00:02:06.159><c> store</c><00:02:07.039><c> value</c><00:02:08.039><c> what</c><00:02:08.160><c> you</c><00:02:08.360><c> can</c><00:02:08.640><c> store</c> actually store value what you can store actually store value what you can store is<00:02:09.800><c> a</c><00:02:10.000><c> set</c><00:02:10.200><c> of</c><00:02:10.399><c> predictions</c><00:02:11.440><c> about</c><00:02:12.440><c> the</c><00:02:12.920><c> world</c> is a set of predictions about the world is a set of
