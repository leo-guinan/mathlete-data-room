now</c><00:01:07.200><c> the</c><00:01:07.320><c> problem</c><00:01:07.560><c> with</c><00:01:07.720><c> that</c><00:01:08.040><c> is</c> options now the problem with that is options now the problem with that is that<00:01:08.360><c> money</c><00:01:09.240><c> is</c><00:01:09.520><c> designed</c><00:01:10.200><c> to</c><00:01:10.960><c> capture</c><00:01:11.360><c> human</c> that money is

we've</c><00:01:16.119><c> ended</c><00:01:16.320><c> up</c><00:01:16.520><c> doing</c> and so what we've ended up doing and so what we've ended up doing inadvertently<00:01:18.240><c> is</c><00:01:18.439><c> we've</c><00:01:18.680><c> created</c><00:01:19.000><c> a</c><00:01:19.159><c> system</c> inadvertently is we've created a system inadvertently is we've created a system that<00:01:20.960><c> sucks</c><00:01:21.560><c> human</c><00:01:21.920><c> risk</c><00:01:22.240><c> in</c><00:01:23.240><c> and</c><00:01:24.119><c> puts</c><00:01:24.360><c> out</c> that sucks human risk in and puts out that sucks human risk in and puts out Bank Bank Bank profits<00:01:26.880><c> and</c><00:01:27.880><c> that's</c><00:01:28.040><c> a</c><00:01:28.240><c> really</c><00:01:28.479><c> bad</c><00:01:28.759><c> system</c><00:01:29.479><c> I</c> profits and that's a really bad system I profits and that's a really bad system I don't<00:01:29.720><c> know</c><00:01:29.960><c> if</c><00:01:30.040><c> you've</c><00:01:30.200><c> been</c><00:01:30.320><c> living</c><00:01:30.520><c> in</c><00:01:30.680><c> the</c> don't know if you've been living in the don't know if you've been living in the economy<00:01:31.240><c> lately</c><00:01:31.840><c> but</c><00:01:32.240><c> uh</c><00:01:32.360><c> I</c><00:01:32.439><c> would</c><00:01:32.600><c> say</c><00:01:32.799><c> things</c> economy lately but uh I would say things economy lately but uh I would say things are<00:01:33.240><c> maybe</c><00:01:33.520><c> not</c><00:01:33.960><c> great</c><00:01:34.960><c> uh</c><00:01:35.360><c> been</c><00:01:35.560><c> way</c><00:01:35.720><c> [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]</c> are maybe not great uh been way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are maybe not great uh been way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] harder<00:01:36.240><c> for</c><00:01:36.399><c> me</c><00:01:36.680><c> than</c><00:01:37.119><c> I</c><00:01:38.119><c> think</c><00:01:38.399><c> they</c><00:01:38.520><c> should</c> harder for me than I think they should harder for me than I think they should be<00:01:39.600><c> uh</c><00:01:39.759><c> and</c><00:01:39.920><c> in</c><00:01:40.159><c> fact</c><00:01:40.600><c> they're</c><00:01:40.920><c> going</c><00:01:41.240><c> to</c><00:01:41.479><c> start</c> be uh and in fact they're going to start be uh and in fact they're going to start getting<00:01:41.920><c> a</c><00:01:42.000><c> lot</c><00:01:42.159><c> easier</c><00:01:42.680><c> because</c><00:01:43.119><c> I'm</c> getting a lot easier because I'm getting a lot easier because I'm breaking<00:01:43.680><c> the</c><00:01:44.119><c> system</c><00:01:45.600><c> and</c><00:01:46.600><c> how</c><00:01:46.759><c> I'm</c><00:01:46.920><c> doing</c><00:01:47.240><c> it</c> breaking the system and how I'm doing it breaking the system and how I'm doing it is<00:01:48.280><c> by</c><00:01:49.280><c> using</c><00:01:50.000><c> the</c><00:01:50.640><c> bank's</c><00:01:51.640><c> inputs</c><00:01:52.240><c> against</c> is by using the bank's inputs against is by using the bank's inputs against them<00:01:54.079><c> they</c><00:01:54.520><c> take</c> them they take them they take risk<00:01:56.439><c> and</c><00:01:56.719><c> they</c><00:01:57.119><c> make</c><00:01:57.479><c> risk</c><00:01:57.920><c> expensive</c> risk and they make risk expensive risk and they make risk expensive and<00:02:00.159><c> then</c><00:02:00.360><c> they</c><00:02:00.479><c> say</c><00:02:01.200><c> humans</c><00:02:02.200><c> you</c><00:02:02.479><c> are</c><00:02:02.759><c> risky</c> and then they say humans you are risky and then they say humans you are risky but<00:02:03.920><c> these</c><00:02:04.159><c> businesses</c><00:02:04.840><c> these</c><00:02:05.119><c> businesses</c> but these businesses these businesses but these businesses these businesses are<00:02:05.880><c> nice</c><00:02:06.119><c> and</c> are nice and are nice and safe<00:02:07.920><c>
