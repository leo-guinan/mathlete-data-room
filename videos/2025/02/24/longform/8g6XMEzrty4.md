**Description**:
Conferences promise innovation, networking, and industry growth, but what if theyâ€™re actually holding us back? Are they truly pushing us forward, or are they just another corporate cash grab?

Beyond the conference bubble, we discuss the lost magic of the internet, a time when online spaces were experimental, creative and well, weird. The internet used to be about genuine connection.

ðŸ’¬ Join the Conversation: Are conferences really worth it, or are they just industry hype? And do you miss the weird, creative internet before algorithms took over? Drop your thoughts in the commentsâ€”weâ€™d love to hear from you!
