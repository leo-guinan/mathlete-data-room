And I started thinking about anyway. And I started thinking about like<01:08:08.160><c> what</c><01:08:08.319><c> a</c><01:08:08.480><c> pitch</c><01:08:08.720><c> deck</c><01:08:09.039><c> might</c><01:08:09.280><c> look</c><01:08:09.520><c> like</c> like what a pitch deck might look like like what a pitch deck might look like for<01:08:10.280><c> that.</c> for that. for that.

This is this is Um and uh this is it. This is this is the<01:08:20.799><c> the</c><01:08:21.279><c> ultimate</c><01:08:21.600><c> solution</c> the the ultimate solution the the ultimate solution um<01:08:24.159><c> that</c><01:08:24.480><c> I</c><01:08:24.719><c> can</c> um that I can um that I can allow<01:08:26.880><c> people</c><01:08:27.279><c> to</c><01:08:28.000><c> uh</c><01:08:28.799><c> to</c><01:08:29.040><c> get</c><01:08:29.279><c> into.</c> allow people to uh to get into. allow people to uh to get into.

So now it's about taking that<01:08:37.839><c> and</c><01:08:38.159><c> turning</c><01:08:38.480><c> it</c><01:08:38.640><c> into</c><01:08:39.199><c> something</c><01:08:39.520><c> else.</c> that and turning it into something else. that and turning it into something else.
