Uh we can actually design<00:16:12.959><c> these</c><00:16:13.279><c> because</c><00:16:13.680><c> everything</c><00:16:14.000><c> is</c> design these because everything is design these because everything is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]<00:16:14.600><c> systems.</c><00:16:15.720><c> So,</c><00:16:16.720><c> we</c><00:16:16.959><c> just</c><00:16:17.199><c> need</c><00:16:17.360><c> to</c> [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] systems. So, we just need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] systems. So, we just need to figure<00:16:17.759><c> out</c><00:16:17.920><c> where</c><00:16:18.079><c> we're</c><00:16:18.320><c> starting</c><00:16:18.560><c> from.</c> figure out where we're starting from. figure out where we're starting from. Um<00:16:20.880><c> and</c><00:16:21.360><c> so</c><00:16:21.600><c> this</c><00:16:21.839><c> idea</c><00:16:22.000><c> of</c><00:16:22.160><c> chaos</c><00:16:22.560><c> networking</c> Um and so this idea of chaos networking Um and so this idea of chaos networking and<00:16:23.199><c> and</c><00:16:23.440><c> chaos</c><00:16:23.759><c> marketing</c><00:16:24.480><c> and</c><00:16:24.720><c> chaos</c> and and chaos marketing and chaos and and chaos marketing and chaos networks<00:16:25.519><c> in</c><00:16:25.680><c> general,</c><00:16:26.279><c> right?</c><00:16:27.279><c> So</c><00:16:27.839><c> basically</c> networks in general, right? So basically networks in general, right? So basically if<00:16:28.880><c> we</c><00:16:29.040><c> think</c><00:16:29.199><c> about</c><00:16:29.440><c> the</c><00:16:29.680><c> different</c><00:16:29.920><c> networks</c> if we think about the different networks if we think about the different networks as<00:16:30.639><c> kind</c><00:16:30.880><c> of</c><00:16:31.240><c> these</c><00:16:32.240><c> nodes</c><00:16:32.720><c> here,</c><00:16:33.040><c> right?</c><00:16:33.360><c> So</c> as kind of these nodes here, right? So as kind of these nodes here, right? So we<00:16:33.759><c> we've</c><00:16:34.160><c> got</c><00:16:34.600><c> these</c><00:16:35.600><c> universes</c><00:16:36.399><c> that</c><00:16:36.720><c> exist.</c> we we've got these universes that exist. we we've got these universes that exist.
