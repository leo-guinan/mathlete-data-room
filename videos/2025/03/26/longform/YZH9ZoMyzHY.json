um<00:00:56.920><c> and</c><00:00:57.920><c> with</c><00:00:58.320><c> AI</c><00:00:59.320><c> I</c><00:00:59.440><c> was</c><00:00:59.600><c> able</c><00:01:00.000><c> to</c><00:01:00.160><c> find</c><00:01:00.640><c> uh</c> um and with AI I was able to find uh um and with AI I was able to find uh data<00:01:01.079><c> annotation</c><00:01:01.640><c> work</c><00:01:02.359><c> which</c><00:01:02.480><c> is</c><00:01:02.680><c> where</c><00:01:02.840><c> I'm</c> data annotation work which is where I'm data annotation work which is where I'm just<00:01:03.199><c> like</c><00:01:03.879><c> generating</c><00:01:04.879><c> code</c><00:01:05.159><c> and</c><00:01:05.280><c> all</c><00:01:05.400><c> sorts</c> just like generating code and all sorts just like generating code and all sorts of<00:01:05.760><c> languages</c><00:01:06.240><c> depending</c><00:01:06.560><c> on</c><00:01:06.840><c> what</c><00:01:07.080><c> the</c><00:01:07.479><c> uh</c> of languages depending on what the uh of languages depending on what the uh annotation<00:01:08.360><c> needs</c><00:01:08.600><c> are</c><00:01:08.840><c> at</c><00:01:09.000><c> any</c><00:01:09.200><c> given</c><00:01:09.880><c> time</c> annotation needs are at any given time annotation needs are at any given time so<00:01:12.000><c> I</c><00:01:12.200><c> use</c><00:01:13.000><c> AI</c><00:01:13.280><c> for</c><00:01:13.439><c> work</c><00:01:13.680><c> a</c><00:01:13.799><c> lot</c><00:01:14.080><c> and</c><00:01:14.479><c> I</c><00:01:14.640><c> also</c> so I use AI for work a lot and I also so I use AI for work a lot and I also just<00:01:15.119><c> use</c><00:01:15.439><c> AI</c><00:01:15.720><c> for</c><00:01:16.080><c>

no twiddle these bits around I was like no you<00:01:44.640><c> can't</c><00:01:44.840><c> do</c><00:01:45.040><c> that</c><00:01:45.280><c> that's</c><00:01:45.479><c> a</c><00:01:45.680><c>

buack like this um a more<00:01:51.399><c> accurate</c><00:01:51.719><c> term</c><00:01:52.000><c> actually</c><00:01:52.280><c> here</c><00:01:52.439><c> would</c> more accurate term actually here would more accurate term actually here would probably<00:01:52.960><c> be</c><00:01:53.079><c> a</c><00:01:53.439><c> homeomorphism</c><00:01:54.439><c> I</c><00:01:54.799><c> realized</c> probably be a homeomorphism I realized probably be a homeomorphism I realized last<00:01:55.439><c> night</c><00:01:55.600><c> as</c><00:01:55.719><c> I</c><00:01:55.840><c> was</c><00:01:56.000><c> refining</c><00:01:56.399><c> things</c><00:01:56.600><c> a</c> last night as I was refining things a last night as I was refining things a bit<00:01:58.600><c> um</c><00:01:59.600><c> so</c><00:02:00.039><c> Let's</c><00:02:00.320><c> uh</c><00:02:00.439><c> let's</c><00:02:00.600><c> try</c><00:02:00.759><c> to</c><00:02:01.000><c> find</c> bit um so Let's uh let's try to find bit um so Let's uh let's try to find that<00:02:01.560><c> actually</c><00:02:02.000><c> just</c><00:02:02.280><c> uh</c><00:02:02.360><c> so</c> that actually just uh so that actually just uh so homeomorphism<00:02:04.320><c> um</c><00:02:05.320><c> can</c><00:02:05.439><c> we</c><00:02:06.039><c> let's</c><00:02:06.159><c> try</c><00:02:06.320><c> to</c><00:02:06.600><c> to</c> homeomorphism um can we let's try to to homeomorphism um can we let's try to to dig<00:02:06.920><c> into</c><00:02:07.119><c> that</c><00:02:07.280><c> that</c><00:02:07.360><c> was</c><00:02:07.520><c> actually</c><00:02:07.680><c> not</c><00:02:07.880><c> a</c> dig into that that was actually not a dig into that that was actually not a term<00:02:08.239><c> that</c><00:02:08.440><c> I'm</c><00:02:08.879><c> uh</c><00:02:09.000><c> familiar</c><00:02:09.440><c> with</c><00:02:09.599><c> so</c><00:02:10.239><c> yeah</c><00:02:10.440><c> I</c> term that I'm uh familiar with so yeah I term that I'm uh familiar with so yeah I can<00:02:10.679><c> introduce</c><00:02:11.120><c> some</c><00:02:11.319><c> basic</c><00:02:11.680><c> terms</c><00:02:12.200><c> there's</c> can introduce some basic terms there's can introduce some basic terms there's not<00:02:12.680><c> all</c><00:02:12.920><c> that</c><00:02:13.400><c> much</c><00:02:13.640><c> to</c><00:02:13.840><c>

it</c><00:03:46.280><c> shows</c><00:03:46.680><c> that</c> diagonalization proof and it shows that diagonalization proof and it shows that the<00:03:46.959><c> real</c><00:03:47.239><c>

and okay<00:04:34.120><c> yeah</c><00:04:34.280><c> not</c><00:04:34.479><c> that</c><00:04:34.720><c> bad</c> um um um so<00:04:41.440><c> there</c><00:04:41.560><c> is</c><00:04:41.680><c>

you</c><00:06:24.440><c> just</c><00:06:24.599><c> keep</c><00:06:24.800><c> going</c><00:06:25.080><c> down</c><00:06:25.360><c> so</c><00:06:25.800><c> you</c> then you just keep going down so you then you just keep going down so you take<00:06:26.280><c> each</c><00:06:26.599><c> piece</c><00:06:26.919><c> and</c><00:06:27.000><c> you</c><00:06:27.120><c> split</c><00:06:27.400><c> them</c><00:06:27.479><c> in</c> take each piece and you split them in take each piece and you split them in half<00:06:27.880><c> again</c><00:06:28.080><c> taking</c><00:06:28.319><c> out</c><00:06:28.479><c> the</c><00:06:28.560><c> middle</c><00:06:28.919><c> again</c> half again taking out the middle again half again taking out the middle again and<00:06:29.880><c> you</c><00:06:30.000><c> just</c><00:06:30.160><c> keep</c><00:06:30.319><c> going</c><00:06:30.560><c> down</c><00:06:30.720><c> and</c><00:06:30.880><c> down</c> and you just keep going down and

you<00:06:59.720><c> need</c><00:06:59.840><c> to</c><00:07:00.000><c> convert</c><00:07:00.319><c> to</c><00:07:00.560><c> tary</c><00:07:01.280><c> first</c><00:07:01.919><c> so</c> you need to convert to tary first so you need to convert to tary first so take take take any<00:07:04.240><c> natural</c><00:07:04.639><c> number</c><00:07:04.960><c> or</c><00:07:05.280><c>

where</c><00:07:20.520><c> you</c> that I just talked about where you that I just talked about where you remove<00:07:21.080><c> the</c><00:07:21.199><c> middle</c><00:07:21.879><c> this</c><00:07:21.960><c> is</c><00:07:22.120><c> just</c><00:07:22.319><c> another</c> remove the middle this is just another remove the middle this is just another way<00:07:22.759><c> of</c><00:07:22.960><c> do</c><00:07:23.120><c> removing</c><00:07:23.560><c> the</c><00:07:23.639><c> middle</c><00:07:23.919><c> but</c><00:07:24.000><c> you're</c> way of do removing the middle but you're way of do removing the middle but you're doing<00:07:24.360><c> it</c><00:07:24.479><c> as</c><00:07:24.560><c> a</c><00:07:24.680><c> bitwise</c><00:07:25.280><c> operation</c><00:07:26.280><c> so</c> doing it as a bitwise operation so doing it as a bitwise operation so they're they're they're equivalent<00:07:28.919><c> okay</c><00:07:29.080><c> so</c><00:07:29.199><c> you're</c> equivalent okay so you're equivalent okay so you're expanding<00:07:31.280><c> okay</c><00:07:31.440><c> so</c><00:07:31.639><c> you're</c><00:07:31.840><c> you're</c><00:07:32.440><c> like</c> expanding okay so you're you're like expanding okay so you're you're like it<00:07:35.160><c> it's</c><00:07:35.440><c> it's</c><00:07:35.639><c>

from</c> thought of it this like so so going from thought of it this like so so going from the<00:07:40.199><c> like</c><00:07:40.360><c> the</c><00:07:40.520><c> binary</c><00:07:40.960><c> to</c><00:07:41.120><c> the</c><00:07:41.280><c> tary</c><00:07:41.840><c> is</c><00:07:42.039><c> like</c> the like the binary to the tary is like the like the binary to the tary is like

it's adding a it's it's almost like adding<00:07:45.280><c> a</c><00:07:45.879><c> dimension</c><00:07:46.879><c> and</c><00:07:47.039><c> then</c><00:07:47.360><c> like</c> adding a dimension and then like adding a dimension and then like squeezing<00:07:48.039><c> out</c><00:07:48.199><c> the</c><00:07:48.319><c> middle</c><00:07:48.639><c> and</c><00:07:48.879><c> kind</c><00:07:49.199><c> of</c><00:07:50.199><c> um</c> squeezing out the middle and kind of um squeezing out the middle and kind of um taking<00:07:51.560><c> what's</c><00:07:51.919><c> left</c><00:07:52.639><c> and</c><00:07:52.800><c> so</c><00:07:53.240><c> it</c><00:07:54.240><c> um</c><00:07:54.759><c> yeah</c><00:07:54.879><c> so</c> taking what's left and so it um yeah so taking what's left and so it um yeah so it<00:07:55.199><c> kind</c><00:07:55.319><c> of</c><00:07:55.720><c> uh</c><00:07:56.720><c> it</c><00:07:56.879><c> pops</c><00:07:57.159><c> it</c><00:07:57.319><c> up</c><00:07:57.840><c> grabs</c><00:07:58.199><c> the</c> it kind of uh it pops it up grabs the it kind of uh it pops it up grabs the middle<00:07:58.639><c> and</c><00:07:58.759><c> then</c><00:07:58.879><c> shrinks</c><00:07:59.199><c> it</c><00:07:59.319><c> back</c><00:07:59.759><c> down</c> middle and then shrinks it back down middle and then shrinks it back down that's that's that's interesting<00:08:02.080><c> yeah</c><00:08:03.080><c> so</c><00:08:03.560><c> this</c><00:08:03.720><c> gets</c><00:08:03.879><c> you</c><00:08:04.080><c> from</c><00:08:04.319><c> n</c> interesting yeah so this gets you from n interesting yeah so this gets you from n to<00:08:04.840><c> the</c><00:08:05.000><c> interval</c> to the interval to the interval 01<00:08:06.960><c>

going from Z1 you just take 01 and then going from Z1 you just take the<00:08:09.520><c> logic</c><00:08:09.879><c> and</c><00:08:09.960><c> you</c><00:08:10.039><c> get</c><00:08:10.159><c> to</c> the logic and you get to the logic and you get to reals reals reals now<00:08:14.680><c> there</c><00:08:14.800><c> are</c><00:08:15.039><c> some</c><00:08:15.240><c> more</c><00:08:15.680><c>

way</c><00:11:21.800><c> is</c> set and what that means by the way is set and what that means by the way is that that that um<00:11:24.600><c> it's</c><00:11:24.800><c> like</c><00:11:24.959><c> a</c><00:11:25.279><c> formal</c><00:11:25.839><c> property</c><00:11:26.720><c> but</c> um it's like a formal property but um it's like a formal property but it<00:11:28.680><c> basically</c><00:11:29.399><c> means</c><00:11:29.920><c> that</c><00:11:30.920><c> any</c><00:11:31.279><c> errors</c><00:11:31.680><c> that</c> it basically means that any errors that it basically means that any errors that you<00:11:32.040><c> accumulate</c><00:11:32.600><c> in</c><00:11:32.760><c> this</c><00:11:32.920><c> context</c><00:11:33.240><c> what</c><00:11:33.320><c> it</c> you

you're</c><00:11:34.480><c> going</c><00:11:34.560><c> to</c> means is that any errors you're going to means is that any errors you're going to accumulate<00:11:36.279><c> are</c><00:11:36.560><c> not</c><00:11:36.800><c> going</c><00:11:36.920><c> to</c><00:11:37.519><c> be</c><00:11:38.440><c> like</c> accumulate are not going to be like accumulate are not going to be like

that</c> aren't going to accumulate in a way that aren't going to accumulate in a way that they<00:11:49.040><c> can</c> they can they can propagate<00:11:51.240><c> which</c><00:11:51.360><c>

it<00:11:53.519><c> means</c><00:11:53.760><c> you</c><00:11:53.880><c> can</c><00:11:54.040><c> just</c><00:11:54.200><c> keep</c><00:11:54.360><c> doing</c><00:11:54.680><c> this</c> it means you can just keep doing this it means you can just keep doing this operation<00:11:56.079><c> and</c><00:11:56.160><c> you're</c><00:11:56.320><c> not</c><00:11:56.480><c> going</c><00:11:56.560><c>

a</c><00:12:23.360><c> lot</c><00:12:23.519><c> of</c><00:12:24.079><c> systems</c><00:12:24.839><c> where</c><00:12:25.240><c> if</c> um you know a lot of systems where if um you know a lot of

this like multi-stage you have kind of this like multi-stage process<00:12:28.320><c> and</c><00:12:28.440><c> there's</c><00:12:28.600><c> a</c><00:12:28.680><c> little</c><00:12:28.839><c> bit</c><00:12:28.959><c> of</c> process and there's a little bit of process and there's a little bit of error<00:12:29.440><c> and</c><00:12:29.519><c> you</c><00:12:29.639><c> kind</c><00:12:29.760><c> of</c><00:12:29.880><c> run</c><00:12:30.120><c> the</c><00:12:30.240><c> same</c> error and you kind of run the same error and you kind of run the same function<00:12:30.880><c> again</c><00:12:31.680><c> that</c><00:12:31.800><c> error</c><00:12:32.040><c> is</c><00:12:32.160><c> going</c><00:12:32.240><c> to</c> function again that error is going to function again that error is going to get<00:12:32.519><c> off</c><00:12:32.760><c> more</c><00:12:32.920><c> and</c><00:12:33.120><c> more</c><00:12:33.680><c> so</c><00:12:34.440><c> from</c><00:12:34.639><c> what</c><00:12:34.760><c> I'm</c> get off more and more so from what I'm get off more and more so from what I'm gathering<00:12:35.480><c> here</c><00:12:36.279><c> what</c><00:12:36.399><c> you're</c><00:12:36.600><c> saying</c><00:12:36.920><c> is</c><00:12:37.160><c> you</c> gathering here what you're saying is you gathering here what you're saying is you know<00:12:37.360><c> you</c><00:12:37.560><c> basically</c><00:12:38.079><c> you</c><00:12:38.279><c> you</c><00:12:38.360><c> can</c><00:12:38.519><c> run</c><00:12:38.760><c> the</c> know you basically you you can run the know you basically you you can run the same<00:12:39.160><c> function</c><00:12:39.519><c> again</c><00:12:39.720><c> and</c><00:12:39.880><c> again</c><00:12:40.079><c> and</c><00:12:40.240><c> keep</c> same function again and again and keep same function again and again and keep that<00:12:40.839><c> constant</c><00:12:41.480><c> error</c><00:12:42.240><c> as</c><00:12:42.399><c> opposed</c><00:12:42.680><c> to</c><00:12:42.839><c> kind</c> that constant error as opposed to kind that constant error as opposed to kind of<00:12:43.120><c> this</c><00:12:43.320><c> compounding</c><00:12:43.880><c> error</c><00:12:44.160><c> that</c><00:12:44.279><c> gets</c><00:12:44.480><c> off</c> of this compounding error that gets off of this compounding error that gets off more<00:12:44.920><c> and</c><00:12:45.160><c> more</c><00:12:45.720><c> as</c><00:12:46.199><c> you</c><00:12:47.199><c> um</c><00:12:47.440><c> kind</c><00:12:47.600><c> of</c><00:12:47.880><c> like</c> more and more as you um kind of like more and more as you um kind of like compound<00:12:48.480><c> the</c><00:12:48.600><c> runs</c><00:12:48.839><c> of</c><00:12:49.000><c> the</c><00:12:49.120><c> function</c><00:12:49.959><c> right</c> compound the runs of the function right compound the runs of the function right yeah<00:12:52.120><c> so</c><00:12:53.120><c> uh</c><00:12:53.360><c> because</c><00:12:53.560><c> of</c><00:12:53.680><c> the</c><00:12:54.000><c> approximation</c> yeah so uh because of the

to</c><00:12:56.279><c> get</c> sometimes you are still going to get sometimes you are still going to get kind<00:12:57.160><c> of</c><00:12:57.399><c> like</c><00:12:57.600><c>

I</c><00:13:07.040><c> mean</c><00:13:07.279><c> what</c><00:13:07.440><c> this</c><00:13:07.560><c> means</c><00:13:07.800><c> is</c><00:13:07.920><c> you</c> so yeah I mean what this means is you so yeah I mean what this means is you get<00:13:08.320><c> results</c><00:13:08.959><c> like</c><00:13:09.959><c> some</c><00:13:10.120><c> of</c><00:13:10.360><c> the</c><00:13:10.959><c>

really</c><00:13:26.160><c> iconic</c><00:13:26.560><c> if</c><00:13:26.680><c> I'm</c> thought was like really iconic if I'm thought was like really iconic if I'm going<00:13:26.880><c> to</c><00:13:27.120><c> do</c><00:13:27.279><c> this</c><00:13:27.360><c> on</c><00:13:27.519><c> some</c><00:13:27.720><c> video</c><00:13:27.959><c> it</c><00:13:28.040><c> should</c> going to do this on some video it should going to do this on some video it should be<00:13:28.320><c> something</c><00:13:28.600><c> iconic</c><00:13:28.920><c> so</c><00:13:29.120><c> so</c><00:13:29.199><c> let's</c><00:13:29.360><c> do</c><00:13:29.639><c> that</c> be something iconic so so let's do that be something iconic so so let's do that um<00:13:31.760><c> the</c><00:13:31.880><c> video</c><00:13:32.120><c> is</c><00:13:32.240><c> showing</c> um the video is showing um the video is showing the<00:13:34.240><c> heat</c><00:13:34.600><c> map</c><00:13:35.000><c> actually</c><00:13:35.240><c> so</c><00:13:35.399><c> it's</c><00:13:35.519><c> showing</c> the heat map actually so it's showing the heat map actually so it's showing what<00:13:35.959><c> ended</c><00:13:36.240><c> up</c><00:13:36.360><c> in</c><00:13:36.480><c> the</c> what ended up in the what ended up in the compliment<00:13:38.720><c> and</c><00:13:39.000><c> as</c><00:13:39.120><c> you</c><00:13:39.199><c> can</c><00:13:39.360><c> see</c><00:13:39.680><c> it</c><00:13:40.120><c> it</c> compliment and as you can see it it compliment and as you can see it it literally<00:13:40.600><c> re-encodes</c><00:13:41.199><c> the</c><00:13:41.320><c> original</c><00:13:41.720><c> video</c> literally re-encodes the original video literally re-encodes the original video in<00:13:42.199><c> a</c><00:13:42.440><c> in</c><00:13:42.519><c> a</c> in a in a in a in a sense<00:13:44.639><c> um</c><00:13:45.639><c> and</c><00:13:45.800><c> the</c><00:13:45.959><c> cats</c> sense um and the cats sense um and the cats one<00:13:47.920><c> that</c><00:13:48.040><c> one</c><00:13:48.199><c> is</c><00:13:48.360><c> showing</c><00:13:49.000><c> like</c><00:13:49.480><c> what</c> one that one is showing like what one that one is showing like what happens<00:13:50.040><c> when</c><00:13:50.160><c> you</c><00:13:50.440><c> vary</c><00:13:51.000><c> the</c><00:13:51.320><c> uh</c><00:13:51.480><c> the</c><00:13:51.600><c> bit</c> happens when you vary the uh the bit happens when you vary the uh the bit depth<00:13:52.399><c> and</c><00:13:52.519><c> the</c> probabilities<00:13:55.880><c> and</c><00:13:56.720><c> the</c><00:13:56.880><c> interesting</c><00:13:57.320><c> thing</c> probabilities and the interesting thing probabilities and the interesting thing is<00:13:57.800><c> that</c> is that is that basically<00:14:00.079><c> the</c><00:14:00.320><c> topology</c><00:14:00.839><c> is</c><00:14:01.040><c> roughly</c> basically the topology is roughly basically the topology is roughly preserved<00:14:02.160><c> in</c><00:14:02.360><c> every</c><00:14:02.759><c>

to<00:14:08.320><c> be</c><00:14:08.959><c> there</c> to be there to be there and<00:14:11.880><c> what's</c><00:14:12.800><c> particularly</c><00:14:13.440><c> interesting</c><00:14:13.880><c> is</c> and what's particularly interesting is and what's particularly interesting is that<00:14:14.160><c> it</c><00:14:14.240><c> seems</c><00:14:14.480><c> to</c><00:14:14.639><c> hold</c><00:14:14.880><c>

you</c><00:14:17.000><c> remove</c><00:14:18.000><c> so</c><00:14:18.240><c> you</c><00:14:18.360><c> can</c><00:14:18.560><c> go</c> information you remove so you can go information you remove so you

silhouettes</c><00:14:25.160><c> of</c><00:14:25.480><c> whatever</c> always get like silhouettes of whatever always get like silhouettes of whatever the<00:14:25.959><c> original</c><00:14:26.320><c>

you</c><00:14:41.399><c> can</c><00:14:41.519><c> see</c><00:14:41.680><c> the</c><00:14:41.839><c> result</c><00:14:42.120><c> of</c> data yeah so you can see the result of data yeah so you can see

is the what's going down the rows is the probability<00:14:55.880><c> I</c> probability I probability I believe<00:14:57.720><c> okay</c> that's<00:15:03.800><c> just</c><00:15:04.240><c> really</c><00:15:04.639><c> cool</c><00:15:05.639><c> I</c><00:15:05.720><c> need</c><00:15:05.880><c> to</c><00:15:05.959><c> start</c> that's just really cool I need to start that's just really cool I need to start research<00:15:06.680><c> so</c><00:15:06.800><c> I</c><00:15:06.880><c> can</c><00:15:07.079><c> get</c><00:15:07.440><c> uh</c><00:15:07.680><c> better</c> research so I can get uh

you</c><00:17:22.679><c> know</c><00:17:22.919><c> this</c><00:17:23.360><c> explanation</c><00:17:23.919><c> to</c><00:17:24.039><c> me</c><00:17:24.199><c> I</c> like you know this explanation to me I like you know this explanation to me I was<00:17:24.480><c> like</c><00:17:25.480><c> I</c><00:17:25.559><c> don't</c><00:17:25.720><c> think</c><00:17:25.839><c> so</c><00:17:26.039><c> I'm</c><00:17:26.160><c> pretty</c> was like I don't think so I'm pretty was like I don't think so I'm pretty sure<00:17:26.439><c> you</c><00:17:26.559><c> could</c><00:17:26.720><c> do</c><00:17:26.919><c> this</c><00:17:27.079><c> if</c><00:17:27.240><c> you</c><00:17:27.760><c> uh</c><00:17:28.199><c> if</c><00:17:28.319><c> you</c> sure you could do this if you uh if you sure you could do this if you uh if you were<00:17:29.039><c> with</c><00:17:29.160><c> an</c><00:17:29.320><c> approximation</c><00:17:30.200><c> so</c><00:17:30.360><c> it's</c><00:17:30.559><c> like</c> were with an approximation so it's like were with an approximation so it's like it<00:17:31.360><c> was</c><00:17:31.840><c> right</c><00:17:32.440><c> but</c><00:17:32.600><c> it's</c><00:17:32.720><c> one</c><00:17:32.840><c> of</c><00:17:33.000><c> those</c> it was right but it's one of those it was right but it's one of those things<00:17:33.400><c> where</c><00:17:33.600><c> being</c><00:17:34.000><c> right</c><00:17:34.240><c> isn't</c><00:17:34.600><c> very</c> things where being right isn't very things where being right isn't very useful<00:17:35.360><c> compared</c><00:17:36.039><c> to</c> useful compared to useful compared to um<00:17:38.640><c> it's</c><00:17:38.840><c> like</c><00:17:39.280><c> if</c><00:17:39.400><c> you</c><00:17:39.480><c> can</c><00:17:39.640><c> be</c> um it's like if you can be um it's like if you can be 99.99%<00:17:41.400><c> right</c><00:17:42.160><c> that's</c><00:17:42.480><c> usually</c><00:17:42.919><c> quite</c><00:17:43.240><c> good</c> 99.99% right that's usually quite good 99.99% right that's usually quite good right<00:17:44.559><c> and</c><00:17:44.880><c> being</c><00:17:45.120><c> aware</c><00:17:45.400><c> that</c><00:17:45.520><c> that's</c> right and being aware that that's right and being aware that that's possible<00:17:46.160><c> is</c><00:17:46.360><c> quite</c><00:17:46.640><c> good</c><00:17:47.039><c> so</c><00:17:47.320><c> dismissing</c><00:17:47.840><c> the</c> possible is quite good so dismissing the possible is quite good so dismissing the possibility<00:17:48.520><c> of</c><00:17:48.799><c> approximations</c><00:17:49.799><c> because</c> possibility of approximations because possibility of approximations because you<00:17:50.160><c> want</c><00:17:50.280><c> to</c><00:17:50.480><c> focus</c><00:17:50.840><c> on</c><00:17:51.840><c> the</c><00:17:52.120><c> full</c><00:17:52.760><c> formal</c> you want to

me</c><00:18:24.919><c> thinking</c> algorithms in particular got me thinking algorithms in particular got me thinking because<00:18:26.400><c> there</c><00:18:26.520><c> was</c><00:18:26.640><c> a</c><00:18:26.840><c> section</c><00:18:27.159><c> in</c><00:18:27.320><c> the</c> because there was a section in the because there was a section in the course course course about about about

the</c> this morning I think about the like the this morning I think about the like the thermodynamics<00:27:49.840><c> of</c><00:27:49.960><c> it</c> thermodynamics of it thermodynamics of it right<00:27:51.720><c> yeah</c><00:27:52.080><c> uh</c><00:27:52.440><c> I</c><00:27:52.519><c> was</c><00:27:52.919><c> prompting</c><00:27:53.480><c> some</c> right yeah uh I was prompting some right yeah uh I was prompting some pretty<00:27:54.200><c> interesting</c><00:27:54.720><c> stuff</c><00:27:55.000><c> and</c><00:27:55.159><c> at</c><00:27:55.320><c> some</c> pretty interesting

I</c><00:27:59.159><c> had</c><00:27:59.399><c> about</c><00:27:59.640><c> diagonalization</c> idea I had about diagonalization idea I had about diagonalization actually<00:28:01.720><c> um</c><00:28:01.880><c> I</c><00:28:01.919><c> don't</c><00:28:02.080><c> want</c><00:28:02.159><c> to</c><00:28:02.919><c> I</c><00:28:03.039><c> could</c><00:28:03.240><c> get</c> actually um I don't want to I could get actually um I don't want to I could get into<00:28:03.640><c> it</c><00:28:03.760><c> but</c><00:28:03.919><c> I'm</c><00:28:04.159><c> like</c><00:28:04.440><c> interrupting</c><00:28:04.960><c> you</c> into it but I'm like interrupting you into it but I'm like interrupting you here<00:28:05.279><c> I</c><00:28:05.440><c> guess</c><00:28:05.600><c> so</c><00:28:05.799><c> I'll</c><00:28:06.360><c> wind</c><00:28:06.600><c> it</c><00:28:06.799><c> down</c><00:28:07.080><c> but</c><00:28:07.519><c> oh</c> here I guess so I'll wind it down but oh here I guess so I'll wind it down but oh no<00:28:07.760><c> no</c><00:28:07.919><c> no</c><00:28:08.080><c> you're</c><00:28:08.240><c> good</c><00:28:08.519><c> I</c><00:28:08.640><c> just</c><00:28:08.880><c> I</c><00:28:09.000><c> go</c><00:28:09.120><c> off</c><00:28:09.440><c> on</c> no no no you're good I just I go off on no no no you're good I just I go off on between<00:28:11.080><c> um</c><00:28:11.600><c> I'll</c><00:28:11.720><c> just</c><00:28:11.840><c> finish</c><00:28:12.080><c> up</c><00:28:12.200><c> in</c><00:28:12.320><c> a</c> between um I'll just finish up in a between um I'll just finish up in a sentence<00:28:12.960><c> it</c><00:28:13.080><c> was</c><00:28:13.240><c> drawing</c><00:28:13.600><c> parallels</c> sentence it was drawing

um</c><00:28:17.440><c> percolation</c> between an idea I had and um percolation between an idea I had and um percolation theory<00:28:18.360><c> in</c><00:28:18.559><c> physics</c><00:28:18.960><c> and</c><00:28:19.159><c> thermodynamics</c><00:28:19.919><c> and</c> theory in physics and thermodynamics and theory in physics and thermodynamics and I<00:28:20.120><c> was</c><00:28:20.279><c> just</c><00:28:20.600><c> like</c><00:28:21.600><c> okay</c><00:28:21.760><c> I'm</c><00:28:21.840><c> GNA</c><00:28:22.039><c> have</c><00:28:22.200><c> to</c> I was just like okay I'm GNA have to I was just like okay I'm GNA have to read<00:28:22.480><c> like</c><00:28:22.600><c> three</c><00:28:22.799><c> textbooks</c> read like three textbooks read like three textbooks now<00:28:26.000><c> yeah</c><00:28:26.279><c> I</c><00:28:26.440><c> think</c><00:28:27.120><c> um</c><00:28:28.159><c> like</c><00:28:28.440><c> the</c><00:28:28.720><c> uh</c><00:28:28.840><c> so</c><00:28:29.000><c> the</c> now yeah I think um like the uh so the now yeah I think um like the uh so the thermodynamics<00:28:29.840><c> piece</c><00:28:30.039><c> is</c><00:28:30.200><c> interesting</c> thermodynamics piece is interesting thermodynamics piece is interesting because<00:28:32.320><c> um</c><00:28:33.200><c> have</c><00:28:33.320><c> you</c><00:28:33.519><c> actually</c><00:28:33.880><c> have</c><00:28:34.000><c> you</c> because um have you actually have you because um have you actually have you noticed<00:28:34.960><c> what</c><00:28:35.519><c> uh</c><00:28:35.640><c> so</c><00:28:35.799><c> there's</c><00:28:36.080><c> this</c><00:28:36.679><c> guy</c><00:28:37.679><c> uh</c><00:28:38.559><c> I</c> noticed what uh so there's this guy uh I noticed what uh so there's this guy uh I think<00:28:38.799><c> his</c><00:28:38.960><c> name</c><00:28:39.159><c> is</c><00:28:39.480><c> Gil</c><00:28:39.799><c> Verdon</c><00:28:40.640><c> uh</c><00:28:40.799><c>

did</c><00:30:38.440><c> industry</c><00:30:38.880><c> for</c> engineering and like I did industry for engineering and like I did industry for a<00:30:39.200><c> while</c><00:30:39.760><c> and</c><00:30:40.159><c> like</c><00:30:40.840><c> that</c><00:30:41.039><c> sucked</c><00:30:41.519><c> and</c><00:30:41.640><c> then</c><00:30:41.919><c> I</c> a while and like that sucked and then I a while and like that sucked and then I I<00:30:42.559><c> did</c><00:30:42.720><c> the</c><00:30:42.840><c> startup</c><00:30:43.240><c> route</c><00:30:43.519><c> and</c><00:30:43.640><c>

there</c><00:33:18.559><c> we</c><00:33:18.720><c> go</c><00:33:18.919><c> mapping</c><00:33:19.279><c> human</c> see there we go mapping human see there we go mapping human potential<00:33:22.320><c> through</c><00:33:22.600><c> iction</c><00:33:23.159><c> that's</c><00:33:23.399><c> cool</c><00:33:24.360><c> uh</c> potential through iction that's cool uh potential through iction that's cool uh yeah<00:33:24.720><c> I</c><00:33:24.799><c> mean</c><00:33:24.919><c> it's</c><00:33:25.080><c> like</c><00:33:25.240><c> a</c><00:33:25.639><c> fundamental</c><00:33:26.559><c> kind</c> yeah I mean it's like a fundamental kind yeah I mean it's like a fundamental kind of<00:33:26.960><c> result</c><00:33:27.440><c> so</c><00:33:28.039><c> there</c><00:33:28.200><c> should</c><00:33:28.519><c> be</c> of result so there should be of result so there should be applications<00:33:30.159><c> everywhere</c><00:33:31.159><c> and</c><00:33:31.760><c> um</c><00:33:32.760><c> the</c><00:33:32.880><c> core</c> applications everywhere and um the core applications everywhere and um the core computation<00:33:33.840><c> is</c><00:33:34.159><c> super</c><00:33:34.639><c> super</c><00:33:35.000><c> easy</c><00:33:35.279><c> to</c> computation is super super easy to computation is super super easy to implement<00:33:35.919><c> it's</c><00:33:36.120><c> literally</c><00:33:36.559><c> just</c><00:33:36.720><c> chopping</c> bits<00:33:43.919><c> and</c><00:33:44.000><c> it</c><00:33:44.159><c> works</c><00:33:44.519><c> it's</c><00:33:44.799><c> based</c><00:33:45.080><c> in</c><00:33:45.200><c> number</c> bits and it works it's based in number bits and it works it's based in number Theory<00:33:45.799><c> so</c><00:33:46.080><c> yeah</c><00:33:46.240><c> you</c><00:33:46.320><c> can</c><00:33:46.480><c> use</c><00:33:46.639><c> it</c><00:33:46.760><c> on</c><00:33:47.000><c> any</c> Theory so yeah you can use it on any Theory so yeah you can use it on any kind<00:33:47.360><c> of</c> data<00:33:50.799><c> yeah</c><00:33:51.039><c> here</c><00:33:51.159><c> we</c><00:33:51.360><c> go</c><00:33:51.559><c> this</c><00:33:51.760><c> is</c> data yeah here we go this is data yeah here we go this is um<00:33:54.519><c> so</c><00:33:54.960><c> the</c><00:33:55.200><c> like</c><00:33:55.720><c> mapping</c><00:33:56.720><c> uh</c><00:33:57.080><c> the</c><00:33:57.200><c> value</c><00:33:57.399><c> of</c> um so the like mapping uh the value of um so the like mapping uh the value of individuals<00:33:58.559><c> within</c><00:33:58.880><c> continuous</c><00:33:59.399><c> economic</c> individuals within continuous economic individuals within continuous economic Frameworks<00:34:00.399><c> there</c><00:34:00.519><c> we</c><00:34:00.720><c> go</c><00:34:01.200><c> yeah</c><00:34:02.200><c> this</c><00:34:02.360><c> is</c><00:34:02.760><c> uh</c> Frameworks there we go yeah this is uh Frameworks there we go yeah this is uh so<00:34:03.080><c> this</c><00:34:03.200><c> is</c><00:34:03.399><c> kind</c><00:34:03.519><c> of</c><00:34:04.240><c> the</c><00:34:05.240><c> I'm</c><00:34:05.399><c>

it<00:34:21.520><c> um</c><00:34:22.159><c> and</c><00:34:22.280><c> it's</c><00:34:22.480><c> really</c><00:34:22.679><c> weird</c><00:34:23.000><c> because</c> it um and it's really weird because it um and it's really weird because we're<00:34:23.280><c> in</c><00:34:23.399><c> this</c><00:34:23.520><c> world</c><00:34:23.800><c> where</c><00:34:24.000><c> everybody</c><00:34:24.679><c> like</c>

anything<00:37:30.720><c> in</c><00:37:30.920><c> the</c><00:37:31.040><c> real</c><00:37:31.480><c> world</c><00:37:32.480><c> um</c><00:37:32.720><c> and</c><00:37:32.839><c> I</c> anything in the real world um and I anything in the real world um and I think<00:37:33.040><c> we</c><00:37:33.160><c> need</c><00:37:33.319><c> to</c><00:37:33.440><c> focus</c><00:37:33.720><c> a</c><00:37:33.839><c> lot</c><00:37:34.000><c> more</c><00:37:34.240><c> on</c> think we need to focus a lot more on think we need to focus a lot more on what's<00:37:34.720><c> actually</c><00:37:34.960><c> getting</c><00:37:35.200><c> done</c><00:37:35.359><c> in</c><00:37:35.480><c> the</c><00:37:35.599><c> real</c> what's actually getting done in the real what's actually getting done in the real world<00:37:37.119><c> uh</c><00:37:37.319><c> because</c><00:37:37.560><c> otherwise</c><00:37:37.960><c> we</c><00:37:38.119><c> end</c> world uh because otherwise we end world uh because otherwise we end up up up uh<00:37:41.680><c> focusing</c><00:37:42.280><c> in</c><00:37:42.680><c> on</c><00:37:42.920><c> just</c><00:37:43.119><c> like</c><00:37:43.319><c> the</c><00:37:43.480><c> the</c> uh focusing in on just like the the uh focusing in on just like the the simulations<00:37:44.079><c> of</c><00:37:44.200><c> the</c><00:37:44.319><c> real</c><00:37:44.480><c> world</c><00:37:44.760><c> and</c> simulations of the real world and simulations of the real world and actually<00:37:45.240><c> this</c><00:37:45.440><c> is</c><00:37:46.440><c> so</c><00:37:46.680><c> this</c><00:37:46.800><c> is</c><00:37:47.000><c> something</c> actually this is so this is something actually this is so this is something that<00:37:47.440><c> maybe</c><00:37:47.680><c> we</c><00:37:47.760><c> could</c><00:37:47.920><c> chat</c><00:37:48.119><c> a</c><00:37:48.240><c> little</c><00:37:48.440><c> bit</c> that maybe we could chat a little bit that maybe we could chat a little bit about<00:37:49.079><c> so</c><00:37:49.720><c> basically</c><00:37:50.280><c> I've</c><00:37:50.440><c> been</c><00:37:50.520><c> working</c><00:37:50.760><c> on</c> about so basically I've been working on about so basically I've been working on this<00:37:51.119><c> idea</c><00:37:51.839><c> of</c><00:37:52.280><c> simulation</c><00:37:53.440><c> Theory</c><00:37:54.440><c> um</c><00:37:54.760><c> and</c> this idea of simulation Theory um and this idea of simulation Theory um and basically<00:37:55.760><c> the</c><00:37:55.920><c> idea</c><00:37:56.480><c> is</c><00:37:57.160><c> that</c> basically the idea is that basically the idea is that let's<00:37:58.560><c> say</c><00:37:58.880><c> you</c><00:37:59.079><c> have</c><00:37:59.200><c> a</c> let's say you have a let's say you have a system<00:38:01.359><c> um</c><00:38:02.079><c> that</c><00:38:02.800><c> can</c><00:38:03.800><c> uh</c><00:38:04.640><c> achieve</c><00:38:05.000><c> some</c> system um that can uh achieve some system um that can uh achieve some result<00:38:06.640><c> um</c><00:38:07.119><c> and</c><00:38:07.240><c> it</c><00:38:07.520><c> has</c><00:38:07.760><c> some</c><00:38:07.920><c> sort</c><00:38:08.119><c> of</c><00:38:08.319><c> energy</c> result um and it has some sort of

is</c><00:38:16.800><c> possible</c><00:38:17.280><c> to</c> result I'm pretty sure it is possible to result I'm pretty sure it is possible to create<00:38:18.119><c> like</c><00:38:18.599><c> a</c><00:38:19.119><c> basically</c><00:38:19.480><c> a</c><00:38:19.599><c> lower</c> create like a basically a lower create like a basically a lower resolution<00:38:20.920><c>

very<00:38:23.359><c> similar</c><00:38:23.680><c> to</c><00:38:23.960><c> actually</c><00:38:24.480><c> like</c> very similar to actually like very similar to actually like taking<00:38:26.319><c> um</c><00:38:26.640><c> you</c><00:38:26.760><c> know</c><00:38:27.160><c> the</c><00:38:27.720><c> the</c><00:38:27.839><c> set</c><00:38:28.160><c> down</c><00:38:28.800><c> to</c> taking um you

uh</c><00:39:43.079><c> man</c><00:39:43.240><c> I</c><00:39:43.400><c> got</c><00:39:43.599><c> way</c><00:39:43.760><c> off</c><00:39:43.880><c> the</c><00:39:44.000><c> topic</c><00:39:44.240><c> of</c> of uh man I got way off the topic of of uh man I got way off the topic of simulation<00:39:44.880><c> Theory</c><00:39:45.599><c> let</c><00:39:45.720><c> me</c><00:39:45.920><c> back</c><00:39:46.079><c> up</c><00:39:46.240><c> to</c> simulation Theory let me back up to simulation Theory let me back up to where<00:39:46.520><c> I</c><00:39:46.640><c> was</c><00:39:46.800><c> going</c><00:39:47.040><c> with</c> where I was going with where I was going with that<00:39:48.800><c> basically</c><00:39:49.400><c> I</c><00:39:49.560><c> think</c><00:39:50.119><c> as</c><00:39:50.400><c> humans</c><00:39:51.160><c> we</c><00:39:51.760><c> will</c> that basically I think as humans we will that basically I think as humans we will really<00:39:52.400><c> easily</c><00:39:53.280><c> simulate</c><00:39:53.800><c> a</c><00:39:54.040><c> result</c><00:39:54.440><c> that's</c> really easily simulate a result that's really easily simulate a result that's not<00:39:54.920><c> fulfilling</c><00:39:55.359><c> a</c><00:39:55.920><c> need</c><00:39:56.920><c> um</c><00:39:57.560><c> that's</c><00:39:57.800><c> actually</c> not fulfilling a need um that's actually not fulfilling a need um that's actually the<00:39:58.440><c> concept</c><00:39:58.800><c> of</c><00:39:59.000><c> like</c><00:39:59.240><c> addiction</c><00:39:59.920><c> right</c><00:40:00.640><c> it</c> the concept of like addiction right it the concept of like addiction right it takes<00:40:01.119><c> more</c><00:40:01.359><c> and</c><00:40:01.520><c> more</c><00:40:02.079><c> to</c><00:40:02.359><c> kind</c><00:40:02.520><c> of</c><00:40:02.800><c> get</c><00:40:03.000><c> the</c> takes more and more to kind of get the takes more and more to kind of get the same<00:40:03.400><c> trigger</c><00:40:04.040><c> because</c><00:40:04.800><c> it's</c><00:40:05.800><c> it's</c><00:40:05.920><c> a</c> same trigger because it's it's a same trigger because it's it's a simulation<00:40:07.200><c> of</c><00:40:07.480><c> some</c><00:40:07.839><c> larger</c><00:40:08.400><c> process</c><00:40:08.760><c> in</c><00:40:08.920><c> the</c> simulation of some larger process in the simulation of some larger process in the body<00:40:10.599><c> um</c><00:40:11.359><c> but</c><00:40:11.880><c> without</c><00:40:12.359><c> kind</c><00:40:12.520><c> of</c><00:40:12.760><c> all</c><00:40:12.960><c> of</c><00:40:13.240><c> the</c> body um but without kind of all of the body um but without kind of all of the extra<00:40:14.079><c> safeguards</c><00:40:14.599><c> in</c><00:40:14.839><c> place</c><00:40:15.200><c> and</c><00:40:15.319><c> so</c><00:40:15.520><c> it</c><00:40:15.760><c> like</c> extra safeguards in place and so it like extra safeguards in place and so it like short<00:40:16.760><c> circuit</c><00:40:17.240><c> that</c><00:40:17.800><c> part</c><00:40:18.800><c> um</c><00:40:19.440><c> and</c><00:40:19.520><c> so</c><00:40:19.720><c> I</c> short circuit that part um and so I short circuit that part um and so I think<00:40:19.960><c> we</c><00:40:20.079><c> can</c><00:40:20.280><c> actually</c><00:40:20.520><c> do</c><00:40:20.720><c> a</c><00:40:20.839><c> lot</c><00:40:21.079><c> with</c> think we can actually do a lot with think we can actually do a lot with modeling modeling modeling of<00:40:23.839><c> uh</c><00:40:24.599><c> simulations</c><00:40:25.599><c> using</c><00:40:26.240><c> just</c><00:40:26.560><c> AI</c><00:40:27.680><c> as</c><00:40:28.359><c> a</c><00:40:29.359><c> um</c> of uh simulations using just AI as a um of uh simulations using just AI as a um basically<00:40:30.200><c> lower</c><00:40:30.560><c> Fidelity</c><00:40:31.079><c> version</c><00:40:31.359><c> of</c> basically lower Fidelity version of basically lower Fidelity version of ourselves<00:40:33.079><c> um</c><00:40:33.240><c> and</c><00:40:33.319><c> so</c><00:40:33.480><c> I'm</c><00:40:33.599><c> playing</c><00:40:33.839><c> around</c> ourselves um and so I'm playing around ourselves um and so I'm playing around with<00:40:34.160><c> the</c><00:40:34.280><c> idea</c><00:40:34.599><c> of</c><00:40:34.760><c> like</c><00:40:34.960><c> actually</c><00:40:36.040><c> values</c><00:40:37.040><c> as</c> with the idea of like actually

something like if you know somebody of something like if you know more<00:45:56.480><c> about</c><00:45:56.720><c> the</c><00:45:57.079><c> situation</c><00:45:57.640><c> than</c><00:45:57.800><c>

thing that's that I thought about uh recently<00:56:18.920><c> that</c><00:56:19.039><c> I</c><00:56:19.119><c> was</c><00:56:19.280><c> like</c><00:56:19.640><c> uh</c><00:56:19.960><c> yeah</c><00:56:20.119><c> that's</c> recently that I was like uh yeah that's recently that I was like uh yeah that's probably<00:56:20.839><c> going</c><00:56:20.960><c> to</c><00:56:21.319><c> matter</c><00:56:21.920><c> um</c><00:56:22.839><c> so</c><00:56:23.240><c> the</c><00:56:23.480><c> I</c> probably going to matter um so the I probably going to matter um so the I think<00:56:23.680><c> the</c><00:56:23.799><c> notion</c><00:56:24.079><c> of</c><00:56:24.200><c> fiat</c><00:56:24.599><c> currency</c><00:56:25.039><c> is</c> think the notion of fiat currency is think the notion of fiat currency is altogether<00:56:25.680><c> going</c><00:56:25.839><c> to</c><00:56:25.960><c> collapse</c><00:56:26.520><c> and</c><00:56:26.680><c> not</c> altogether going to

but</c><00:56:28.440><c> from</c><00:56:28.599><c> the</c> even from the Bitcoin angle but from the even from the Bitcoin angle but from the angle<00:56:29.200><c> of</c><00:56:30.200><c> well</c><00:56:30.799><c> why</c><00:56:30.920><c> would</c><00:56:31.079><c> you</c><00:56:31.200><c> need</c><00:56:31.319><c> a</c><00:56:31.440><c> fiat</c> angle of well why would you need a fiat angle of well why would you need a fiat currency<00:56:32.200><c> when</c><00:56:32.280><c> you</c><00:56:32.359><c> have</c><00:56:32.559><c> compute</c><00:56:33.039><c> instead</c> currency when you have compute instead currency when you have compute instead and<00:56:33.839><c> you</c><00:56:33.920><c> can</c><00:56:34.039><c> do</c><00:56:34.280><c> anything</c><00:56:34.559><c> you</c><00:56:34.680><c> want</c><00:56:34.880><c> with</c> and you can do anything you want with and you can do anything you want with compute<00:56:35.480><c> and</c><00:56:35.640><c> compute</c><00:56:35.960><c> is</c><00:56:36.079><c> a</c><00:56:36.200><c> general</c> compute and compute is a general compute and compute is a general resource<00:56:36.960><c> that</c><00:56:37.119><c> everybody</c><00:56:37.520><c> wants</c><00:56:38.240><c> so</c><00:56:38.440><c> then</c> resource that everybody wants so then resource that everybody wants so then just<00:56:38.880><c> tie</c><00:56:39.200><c> currency</c><00:56:39.559><c> to</c><00:56:40.200><c> compute</c><00:56:41.200><c> that's</c> just tie currency to compute that's just tie currency to compute that's going<00:56:41.480><c> to</c><00:56:41.599><c> be</c><00:56:41.720><c> the</c><00:56:41.839><c> future</c><00:56:42.839><c> so</c> going to be the future so going to be the future so actually<00:56:44.760><c> yes</c><00:56:45.119><c> kind</c><00:56:45.319><c> of</c><00:56:46.480><c> um</c><00:56:47.480><c> but</c><00:56:47.839><c> on</c><00:56:48.200><c> there</c> actually yes kind of um but on there actually yes kind of um but on there there<00:56:48.520><c> there's</c><00:56:48.720><c> something</c><00:56:49.000><c> more</c><00:56:49.200><c> General</c> there there's something more General there there's something more General there<00:56:49.720><c> so</c><00:56:49.880><c> I</c><00:56:50.000><c> agree</c><00:56:50.319><c> that</c><00:56:50.480><c> fiat's</c><00:56:50.920><c> not</c><00:56:51.079><c> going</c> there so I agree that fiat's not going there so I agree that fiat's not going to<00:56:51.839><c> work</c><00:56:52.839><c> um</c><00:56:53.359><c> and</c><00:56:53.599><c> actually</c><00:56:54.119><c> the</c><00:56:54.760><c> the</c><00:56:54.880><c> whole</c> to work um and actually the the whole to work um and actually the the whole idea<00:56:55.440><c> of</c><00:56:55.680><c> like</c><00:56:55.960><c> bit</c><00:56:56.240><c> Bitcoin</c><00:56:56.760><c> is</c><00:56:56.839><c> a</c><00:56:57.000><c> broken</c> idea of like bit Bitcoin is a broken idea of like bit Bitcoin is a broken concept<00:56:57.720><c> too</c><00:56:58.039><c> because</c><00:56:58.200><c> I</c><00:56:58.319><c> realized</c><00:56:58.680><c> you</c><00:56:58.839><c> can't</c> concept too because I realized you can't concept too because I realized you can't actually<00:56:59.480><c> store</c> actually store actually store value<00:57:01.839><c> um</c><00:57:02.720><c> all</c><00:57:02.880><c> you</c><00:57:03.039><c> can</c><00:57:03.400><c> do</c><00:57:03.839><c> is</c><00:57:04.000><c> store</c><00:57:04.880><c> a</c> value um all you can do is store a value um all you can do is store a prediction<00:57:07.559><c> about</c><00:57:07.799><c> a</c><00:57:08.000><c> future</c> prediction about a future prediction about a future state<00:57:10.079><c> so</c><00:57:10.760><c> past</c><00:57:11.119><c> State</c><00:57:11.400><c> isn't</c><00:57:11.640><c> it</c><00:57:12.000><c> it's</c><00:57:12.280><c> the</c> state so past State isn't it it's the state so past State isn't it it's the fact<00:57:12.599><c> that</c><00:57:12.760><c> you</c><00:57:13.119><c> Min</c><00:57:13.480><c> the</c><00:57:13.599><c> coins</c><00:57:13.880><c> so</c><00:57:14.079><c> you</c><00:57:14.200><c> found</c> fact that you Min the coins so you found fact that you Min the coins so you found the<00:57:15.240><c> cryptographic</c><00:57:16.119><c> cash</c><00:57:16.440><c> or</c><00:57:16.599><c> whatever</c><00:57:17.119><c> well</c> the cryptographic cash or whatever well the cryptographic cash or whatever well so<00:57:17.760><c> that's</c><00:57:18.119><c> just</c><00:57:18.480><c> a</c><00:57:19.079><c> storage</c> so that's just a storage so that's just a storage mechanism<00:57:21.200><c> so</c><00:57:21.839><c> what</c><00:57:22.000><c> that</c><00:57:22.160><c> is</c><00:57:22.480><c> though</c><00:57:22.920><c> it's</c> mechanism so what that is though it's mechanism so what that is though it's it's<00:57:23.280><c> not</c><00:57:23.400><c> a</c><00:57:23.520><c> store</c><00:57:23.799><c> of</c><00:57:24.000><c> value</c><00:57:24.599><c> because</c><00:57:24.839><c> what</c> it's not a store of value because what it's not a store of value because what it<00:57:25.160><c> is</c><00:57:26.440><c> it</c><00:57:26.760><c> it</c><00:57:26.920><c> represents</c><00:57:27.440><c> something</c><00:57:27.799><c> and</c><00:57:27.920><c> so</c> it is it it represents something and so it is it it

you</c><00:58:03.680><c> realize</c><00:58:04.000><c> you</c><00:58:04.160><c> can't</c><00:58:04.359><c> store</c> like so when you realize you can't store like so when you realize you can't store

of</c><00:58:06.599><c> a</c> value and it's in fact just a store of a value and it's in fact just a store of a prediction<00:58:07.200><c> about</c><00:58:07.440><c> the</c><00:58:08.039><c> future</c><00:58:09.039><c> that</c><00:58:09.200><c> gets</c> prediction about the future that gets prediction about the future that gets really<00:58:09.760><c> interesting</c><00:58:10.359><c> with</c><00:58:10.559><c> AI</c><00:58:11.000><c> because</c><00:58:11.359><c> again</c> really interesting with AI because again really interesting with AI because again the<00:58:12.480><c> future</c><00:58:12.839><c> is</c><00:58:13.079><c> becoming</c><00:58:13.720><c> both</c><00:58:14.039><c> more</c> the future is becoming both more the future is becoming both more

more</c> predictable uh so it's becoming more predictable uh so it's becoming more predictable<00:58:19.200><c> on</c><00:58:19.319><c> the</c><00:58:19.520><c> micro</c><00:58:20.520><c>

can</c><01:01:49.400><c> kind</c><01:01:49.480><c> of</c><01:01:49.640><c> balance</c><01:01:50.119><c> that</c> math so that we can kind of balance that math so that we can kind of balance that out<01:01:52.799><c> once</c><01:01:53.000><c> we</c><01:01:53.160><c> got</c><01:01:53.359><c> computers</c><01:01:53.880><c> it</c><01:01:54.039><c> became</c> out once we got computers it became out once we got computers it became really<01:01:54.599><c> easy</c><01:01:54.880><c> to</c><01:01:55.119><c> just</c><01:01:55.359><c> optimize</c><01:01:56.079><c> that</c><01:01:56.279><c> and</c><01:01:56.520><c> go</c> really easy to just optimize that and go really easy to just optimize that and go oh<01:01:57.520><c> cool</c><01:01:57.880><c> like</c><01:01:58.160><c> there's</c><01:01:58.359><c> no</c><01:01:58.520><c> risk</c><01:01:58.799><c> anymore</c> oh cool like there's no risk anymore oh cool like there's no risk anymore like<01:01:59.440><c> we</c><01:01:59.559><c> just</c><01:01:59.680><c> have</c><01:01:59.880><c> enough</c><01:02:00.039><c> money</c><01:02:00.279><c> to</c><01:02:00.440><c> win</c><01:02:00.760><c> we</c> like we just have enough money to win we like we just have enough money to win we can<01:02:01.119><c> just</c><01:02:01.880><c> build</c><01:02:02.160><c> the</c><01:02:02.279><c> system</c><01:02:02.559><c> and</c><01:02:02.720><c> take</c><01:02:03.359><c> over</c> can just build the system and take over can just build the system and take over um<01:02:05.000><c> and</c><01:02:05.200><c> so</c><01:02:05.680><c> it</c><01:02:05.839><c> requires</c><01:02:06.440><c> now</c><01:02:06.880><c> I</c><01:02:07.000><c> think</c> um and so it requires now I think um and so it requires now I think systems<01:02:08.000><c> that</c><01:02:08.359><c> are</c><01:02:09.359><c> uh</c><01:02:09.559><c> a</c><01:02:09.680><c> bit</c><01:02:09.839><c> more</c><01:02:10.079><c>

company's hims and company's hims and hers<01:02:47.119><c> um</c><01:02:47.599><c> are</c><01:02:47.799><c> are</c><01:02:48.319><c> manufacturing</c><01:02:49.520><c> OIC</c><01:02:50.520><c> uh</c><01:02:50.680><c> as</c> hers um are are manufacturing OIC uh as hers um are are manufacturing OIC uh as part<01:02:51.000><c> of</c><01:02:51.200><c> some</c><01:02:51.880><c>

it was not not loophole necessarily but it was like<01:02:55.359><c> a</c><01:02:55.400><c> shorted</c> like a shorted like a shorted issue<01:02:57.319><c> and</c><01:02:57.400><c> so</c><01:02:57.599><c> they</c><01:02:57.680><c> were</c><01:02:57.839><c> able</c><01:02:58.079><c> to</c><01:02:58.400><c> to</c><01:02:58.640><c> craft</c> issue and so they were able to to craft issue and so they were able to to craft this<01:03:00.400><c> uh</c><01:03:00.839><c> formula</c><01:03:01.839><c> and</c><01:03:02.319><c> basically</c><01:03:02.680><c> the</c><01:03:02.799><c> rule</c> this uh formula and basically the rule this uh formula and basically the rule changed<01:03:03.359><c> again</c><01:03:03.480><c> and</c><01:03:03.599><c> they're</c><01:03:03.720><c> like</c><01:03:04.000><c> okay</c><01:03:04.119><c> well</c> changed again and they're like okay well changed again and they're like okay well now<01:03:04.400><c> it's</c><01:03:04.520><c> got</c><01:03:04.599><c> to</c><01:03:04.720><c> go</c><01:03:04.880><c> back</c><01:03:05.000><c> to</c><01:03:05.119><c> just</c><01:03:05.240><c> the</c> now it's got to go back to just the now it's got to go back to just the manufacturer<01:03:06.559><c> well</c><01:03:06.680><c> they're</c><01:03:06.799><c> just</c><01:03:06.920><c> going</c><01:03:07.000><c> to</c> manufacturer well they're just going to manufacturer well they're just going to keep<01:03:07.359><c> making</c><01:03:07.640><c> it</c><01:03:08.000><c> because</c><01:03:08.279><c> they're</c><01:03:08.440><c>

disobeying</c> they're going to get for like disobeying they're going to get for like disobeying the the the rules<01:03:16.079><c> that's</c><01:03:16.200><c> a</c><01:03:16.319><c>

oh</c><01:03:42.839><c> let's</c><01:03:43.039><c> just</c><01:03:43.240><c> build</c><01:03:43.640><c> this</c> results of like oh let's just build this results of like oh let's just build this

get</c><01:03:52.599><c> Terminator</c><01:03:53.599><c> um</c><01:03:53.880><c> but</c><01:03:54.000><c> if</c><01:03:54.079><c> we</c><01:03:54.279><c> actually</c> you get Terminator um but if we

you</c><01:05:14.960><c> declare</c> antibiotics but why would you declare antibiotics but why would you declare war<01:05:15.480><c> in</c><01:05:15.720><c> bacteria</c><01:05:16.160><c> it</c><01:05:16.240><c> just</c><01:05:16.359><c> doesn't</c><01:05:17.039><c> like</c><01:05:17.160><c> we</c> war in bacteria it just doesn't like we war in bacteria it just doesn't like we even<01:05:17.680><c> go</c><01:05:17.839><c> through</c><01:05:18.039><c> the</c><01:05:18.200><c> plagues</c><01:05:18.559><c> and</c><01:05:18.720><c> we</c><01:05:18.839><c> still</c> even go through the plagues and we still even go through the plagues and we still don't<01:05:19.200><c> go</c><01:05:19.400><c> wipe</c><01:05:19.559><c> out</c><01:05:19.839><c> bacteria</c><01:05:20.640><c> right</c><01:05:21.640><c> like</c> don't go wipe out bacteria right like don't go wipe out bacteria right like that<01:05:22.160><c> because</c><01:05:22.359><c> we</c><01:05:22.520><c> recognized</c><01:05:23.000><c> that</c><01:05:23.039><c> would</c> that because we recognized that would that because we recognized that would just<01:05:23.279><c> be</c><01:05:23.400><c> a</c><01:05:23.559><c> really</c><01:05:23.760><c> dumb</c><01:05:24.039><c> idea</c><01:05:24.400><c> that</c><01:05:24.520><c> wouldn't</c> just be a really dumb idea that wouldn't just be a really dumb idea that wouldn't be<01:05:25.039><c> good</c><01:05:25.480><c> that</c><01:05:25.799><c> would</c><01:05:26.000><c> completely</c> be good that would completely be good that would completely destabilize<01:05:27.680><c> the</c><01:05:27.839><c> biomes</c><01:05:28.240><c> of</c><01:05:28.440><c> Earth</c><01:05:28.799><c> and</c><01:05:28.960><c> it</c> destabilize the biomes of Earth and it destabilize the biomes of Earth and it would<01:05:29.200><c> just</c><01:05:29.319><c> not</c><01:05:29.480><c> be</c><01:05:29.640><c> a</c><01:05:29.720><c> tenable</c><01:05:30.200><c> position</c><01:05:30.680><c> so</c> would just not be a tenable position so would just not be a tenable position so uh<01:05:31.640><c> I</c><01:05:31.720><c> think</c><01:05:31.920><c> AI</c><01:05:32.279><c> is</c><01:05:32.400><c> going</c><01:05:32.480><c> to</c><01:05:32.799><c> be</c><01:05:33.119><c> in</c><01:05:33.240><c> the</c><01:05:33.359><c> same</c> uh I think AI is going to be in the same uh I think AI is going to be in the same position<01:05:33.960><c> they're</c><01:05:34.079><c> going</c><01:05:34.200><c> to</c><01:05:34.279><c> be</c><01:05:34.440><c> like</c><01:05:34.680><c> well</c> position they're going to be like well position they're going to be like well yeah<01:05:35.599><c> there's</c><01:05:35.880><c> tensions</c><01:05:36.440><c> between</c><01:05:37.240><c> AIS</c><01:05:37.920><c> of</c> yeah there's tensions between AIS of yeah there's tensions between AIS of various<01:05:38.440><c> forms</c><01:05:39.240><c> I</c><01:05:39.400><c> guess</c><01:05:39.799><c> I</c><01:05:39.920><c> think</c><01:05:40.279><c> machine</c> various forms I guess I think machine various forms I guess I think machine intelligence<01:05:41.079><c> will</c><01:05:41.240><c> be</c><01:05:41.319><c> a</c><01:05:41.400><c> nice</c><01:05:41.599><c> way</c><01:05:41.720><c> to</c><01:05:41.839><c>

one</c><01:06:04.119><c> is</c><01:06:04.480><c> that</c><01:06:05.480><c> uh</c> previously um one is that uh previously um one is that uh intelligence<01:06:06.599><c> isn't</c><01:06:07.200><c> a</c><01:06:07.359><c> function</c><01:06:07.880><c> of</c> intelligence isn't a function of intelligence isn't a function of individuals<01:06:08.880><c> it's</c><01:06:09.039><c> a</c><01:06:09.160><c> function</c><01:06:09.440><c> of</c> individuals it's a function of individuals it's a function of networks<01:06:11.640><c> um</c><01:06:12.640><c> and</c><01:06:13.240><c>

uh</c><01:06:16.200><c> I</c><01:06:16.319><c> believe</c><01:06:17.319><c> can</c><01:06:17.880><c> be</c><01:06:18.880><c> um</c><01:06:19.880><c> figured</c><01:06:20.279><c> out</c> this uh I

basically you you you need<01:06:58.160><c> to</c><01:06:58.440><c> figure</c><01:06:58.920><c> out</c><01:07:00.079><c> um</c><01:07:01.079><c> your</c><01:07:01.799><c> uh</c><01:07:02.319><c> the</c><01:07:02.480><c> idea</c> need to figure out um your uh the idea need to figure out um your uh the idea of<01:07:02.960><c> truth</c><01:07:03.279><c> from</c><01:07:03.559><c> your</c><01:07:04.039><c> perspective</c><01:07:05.039><c> from</c><01:07:05.319><c> from</c> of truth from your perspective from from of truth from your perspective from from your<01:07:05.720><c>

models<01:08:46.960><c> as</c> models as models as individuals<01:08:49.239><c> I</c><01:08:49.400><c> think</c><01:08:49.960><c> of</c><01:08:50.960><c> systems</c><01:08:51.759><c> that</c> individuals I think of systems that individuals I think of systems that have<01:08:53.880><c> people</c><01:08:54.279><c> and</c><01:08:54.600><c> AIS</c><01:08:55.920><c> working</c><01:08:56.560><c>

an</c> because uncertainty is something that an because uncertainty is something that an AI<01:11:22.159><c> system</c><01:11:22.520><c> can</c><01:11:22.760><c> learn</c><01:11:23.440><c>

we</c><01:11:27.199><c> kind</c><01:11:27.320><c> of</c><01:11:27.480><c> think</c><01:11:27.640><c> of</c><01:11:27.760><c> it</c><01:11:28.000><c> that</c><01:11:28.159><c> way</c> so when we kind

like</c><01:11:31.520><c> you</c><01:11:32.320><c> feed</c> it's like oh yeah actually like you feed it's like oh yeah actually like you feed an<01:11:32.920><c> AI</c><01:11:33.600><c> uncertainty</c><01:11:34.560><c> it</c><01:11:34.719><c> makes</c><01:11:34.960><c> it</c> an AI uncertainty it makes it an AI uncertainty it makes it predictable<01:11:36.000><c>

it's a matter of like<01:21:10.920><c> okay</c><01:21:11.159><c> well</c><01:21:11.320><c> the</c><01:21:11.440><c> way</c><01:21:11.560><c> you</c><01:21:11.679><c> do</c><01:21:11.960><c> that</c><01:21:12.360><c> when</c> like okay well the way you do that when like okay well the way you do that when you<01:21:13.040><c> have</c><01:21:14.040><c> uh</c><01:21:14.199><c> untrusted</c><01:21:14.800><c> sources</c><01:21:15.360><c> is</c> you have uh untrusted sources is you have uh untrusted sources is basically<01:21:16.040><c> you</c><01:21:16.280><c>

as<01:21:17.520><c> you</c><01:21:17.679><c> can</c><01:21:18.000><c> many</c><01:21:18.280><c> sources</c><01:21:18.719><c> as</c><01:21:18.840><c> you</c><01:21:19.040><c> can</c><01:21:20.040><c> and</c> as you can many sources as you can and as you can many sources as you can and try try try to<01:21:22.120><c> figure</c><01:21:23.040><c> out</c><01:21:24.040><c> what</c><01:21:24.320><c> the</c><01:21:24.920><c> the</c><01:21:25.120><c> most</c><01:21:25.400><c> true</c> to figure out what the the most true to figure out what the the most true most<01:21:26.360><c> accurate</c><01:21:26.800><c> thing</c><01:21:27.400><c> is</c><01:21:28.400><c> um</c><01:21:29.400><c> and</c><01:21:29.520><c> that's</c> most accurate thing is um and that's most accurate thing is um and that's what<01:21:29.760><c> I</c><01:21:29.840><c> think</c><01:21:30.000><c> we</c><01:21:30.080><c> can</c><01:21:30.280><c> actually</c><01:21:30.560><c> do</c> what I think we can actually do what I think we can actually do automatically<01:21:31.600><c> and</c><01:21:31.840><c> like</c><01:21:32.040><c> hey</c><01:21:32.239><c> this</c><01:21:32.480><c> isn't</c> automatically and like hey this isn't automatically and like hey this isn't 100%<01:21:34.120><c> true</c><01:21:34.719><c> but</c><01:21:35.600><c> hey</c><01:21:36.000><c> it</c><01:21:36.159><c> you</c><01:21:36.280><c> know</c><01:21:36.920><c> we've</c><01:21:37.120><c> got</c> 100% true but hey it you know we've got 100% true but hey it you know we've got five<01:21:37.520><c> sources</c><01:21:37.960><c> here</c><01:21:38.159><c> and</c><01:21:38.320><c> three</c><01:21:38.480><c> of</c><01:21:38.600><c> them</c> five sources here and three of them five sources here and three of them

this is true so we'll we'll agree that this is true so we'll we'll throw<01:21:40.440><c> a</c><01:21:40.600><c> 60%</c><01:21:41.239><c> probability</c><01:21:41.719><c> on</c><01:21:42.040><c> that</c><01:21:42.960><c> I</c><01:21:43.040><c> think</c> throw a 60% probability on that I think throw a 60% probability on that I think we<01:21:43.280><c> need</c><01:21:43.440><c>

you'll probably<01:23:33.560><c> be</c><01:23:33.679><c> able</c><01:23:34.120><c> to</c><01:23:35.120><c> um</c><01:23:35.760><c> kind</c><01:23:35.880><c> of</c><01:23:36.080><c> grasp</c><01:23:36.440><c> it</c> probably be able to um kind of grasp it probably be able to um kind of grasp it but<01:23:36.800><c> basically</c><01:23:37.520><c> in</c><01:23:38.159><c> any</c><01:23:39.159><c> communication</c> but basically in any communication but basically in any communication system<01:23:42.000><c> um</c><01:23:43.000><c> you</c> system um you system um you can<01:23:45.639><c> basically</c><01:23:46.239><c> really</c><01:23:46.679><c> easily</c> can basically really easily can basically really easily identify<01:23:49.480><c> like</c><01:23:49.600><c> so</c><01:23:49.880><c> when</c><01:23:50.000><c> you</c><01:23:50.280><c> have</c><01:23:50.679><c> this</c><01:23:51.080><c> like</c> identify like so when you have this like identify like so when you have this like single<01:23:52.840><c> narrative</c><01:23:53.840><c> um</c><01:23:54.120><c> that</c><01:23:54.320><c> the</c><01:23:54.440><c> that's</c> single narrative um that the that's single narrative um that the that's being being being pushed<01:23:56.840><c> um</c><01:23:57.639><c> it's</c><01:23:57.880><c> really</c><01:23:58.199><c> easy</c><01:23:58.600><c> to</c><01:23:58.920><c> like</c><01:23:59.440><c> Trace</c> pushed um it's really easy to like Trace pushed um it's really easy to like Trace that<01:24:00.280><c> because</c><01:24:00.719><c> it</c><01:24:00.840><c> it</c><01:24:00.960><c> makes</c><01:24:01.159><c> a</c><01:24:01.320><c> predictable</c> that because it it makes a predictable that because it it makes a predictable

their</c><01:28:37.600><c> cut</c> everybody at the top to take their cut everybody at the top to take their cut and<01:28:38.159><c> it's</c><01:28:38.280><c> going</c><01:28:38.400><c> to</c><01:28:38.480><c> be</c><01:28:38.560><c> the</c><01:28:38.639><c> biggest</c><01:28:38.960><c> cut</c><01:28:39.280><c> and</c> and it's going to be the biggest cut and and it's going to be the

and</c><01:28:40.880><c> then</c> then you put it down the pie and then then you put it down the pie and then that<01:28:41.239><c> person</c><01:28:41.480><c> takes</c><01:28:41.679><c> a</c><01:28:41.840><c> slightly</c><01:28:42.159><c> smaller</c><01:28:42.560><c> cut</c> that person takes a slightly smaller cut that person takes a slightly smaller cut and<01:28:43.239><c> that</c><01:28:43.400><c> goes</c><01:28:43.679><c> down</c><01:28:43.960><c> and</c><01:28:44.080><c> by</c><01:28:44.199><c> the</c><01:28:44.320><c> time</c><01:28:44.440><c> it</c> and that goes down and by the time it and that goes down and by the time it actually<01:28:44.760><c> gets</c><01:28:44.920><c> to</c><01:28:45.080><c> the</c><01:28:45.159><c> people</c><01:28:45.360><c> that's</c> actually gets to the people that's actually gets to the people that's helping<01:28:46.320><c> there's</c><01:28:46.560><c> nothing</c><01:28:46.840><c> actually</c><01:28:47.119><c> left</c><01:28:47.480><c> no</c> helping there's nothing actually left no helping there's nothing actually left no problems<01:28:47.880><c> are</c><01:28:48.119><c> solved</c><01:28:48.920><c> but</c><01:28:49.040><c> we've</c><01:28:49.239><c> got</c><01:28:49.440><c> this</c> problems are solved but we've got this problems are solved but we've got this great<01:28:49.920><c> hugely</c><01:28:50.280><c> complex</c><01:28:50.679><c> system</c><01:28:50.960><c> where</c> great hugely complex system where great hugely complex system where everybody's<01:28:51.639><c> really</c><01:28:51.920><c> valuable</c><01:28:52.400><c> because</c><01:28:52.639><c> they</c> everybody's really valuable because they everybody's really valuable because they said<01:28:53.000><c> so</c><01:28:53.320><c> because</c><01:28:53.480><c> they</c><01:28:53.600><c> got</c><01:28:53.719><c> that</c><01:28:54.360><c> for</c><01:28:54.480><c> that</c> said so because they got that for that said so because they got that for that money money money um<01:28:57.800><c> so</c><01:28:58.760><c> I</c><01:28:58.880><c> think</c><01:28:59.080><c> we're</c><01:28:59.280><c> going</c><01:28:59.360><c> to</c><01:28:59.560><c> start</c> um so I think we're going to start um so I think we're going to start seeing<01:29:00.920><c> retroactive</c><01:29:01.719><c> government</c><01:29:02.119><c> payments</c> seeing retroactive government payments seeing retroactive government payments for for for results<01:29:05.000><c> um</c> results um results um and<01:29:08.960><c> I</c><01:29:09.119><c> actually</c><01:29:09.400><c> think</c><01:29:09.800><c> oh</c><01:29:10.119><c> that's</c> and I actually think oh that's and I actually think oh that's interesting<01:29:10.760><c> I</c><01:29:10.880><c> just</c><01:29:11.320><c> realized</c><01:29:12.320><c> maybe</c><01:29:12.719><c> the</c><01:29:13.400><c> I</c> interesting I just realized maybe the I interesting I just realized maybe the I I<01:29:13.760><c> I've</c><01:29:14.040><c> kind</c><01:29:14.159><c> of</c><01:29:14.320><c> thought</c><01:29:14.480><c> for</c><01:29:14.639><c> a</c><01:29:14.760><c> while</c><01:29:14.960><c> that</c> I I've kind of thought for a while that I I've kind of thought for a while that taxes<01:29:15.480><c> are</c><01:29:15.719><c> completely</c><01:29:16.600><c> um</c><01:29:17.320><c> dumb</c><01:29:17.800><c> now</c> taxes are completely um dumb now taxes are completely um dumb now basically<01:29:18.880><c> it's</c> basically it's basically it's like<01:29:21.280><c> it's</c><01:29:21.480><c> a</c><01:29:21.719><c> bunch</c><01:29:22.360><c> of</c><01:29:23.000><c> like</c><01:29:23.560><c> number</c> like it's a bunch of like number like it's a bunch of like number crunching<01:29:24.520><c> that</c><01:29:24.719><c> just</c><01:29:24.960><c> is</c><01:29:25.320><c> absolutely</c><01:29:25.920><c> not</c> crunching that just is absolutely not crunching that just is absolutely not necessary<01:29:26.760><c> and</c><01:29:26.880><c> is</c><01:29:26.960><c> a</c><01:29:27.119><c> waste</c><01:29:27.320><c> of</c><01:29:27.480><c> human</c><01:29:28.040><c> Talent</c> necessary and is a waste of human Talent necessary and is a waste of human Talent um<01:29:29.679><c> but</c><01:29:29.840><c> maybe</c><01:29:30.119><c> the</c><01:29:30.239><c> answer</c><01:29:30.480><c> is</c><01:29:30.679><c> actually</c> um but maybe the answer is actually um but maybe the answer is actually reverse reverse reverse taxes<01:29:32.960><c> um</c><01:29:33.239><c> to</c><01:29:33.520><c> where</c><01:29:34.199><c> you</c><01:29:34.440><c> get</c><01:29:35.000><c> paid</c><01:29:35.400><c> more</c><01:29:36.040><c> for</c> taxes um to where you get paid more for taxes um to where you get paid more for Value<01:29:37.159><c> you</c><01:29:37.440><c> created</c><01:29:38.199><c> over</c><01:29:38.679><c> what</c><01:29:38.840><c> you</c><01:29:39.000><c> were</c> Value you created over what you were Value you created over what you were

the the value you've created measure the the value you've created around<01:29:44.679><c> you</c><01:29:45.360><c> that</c><01:29:45.480><c> could</c><01:29:45.600><c> be</c><01:29:45.719><c> an</c><01:29:45.840><c> interesting</c> around you that could be an interesting around you that could be an interesting model<01:29:46.760><c> I</c><01:29:46.840><c> don't</c><01:29:47.000><c> see</c><01:29:47.239><c> that</c><01:29:47.400><c> happening</c><01:29:47.719><c> with</c> model I don't see that happening with model I don't see that happening with current<01:29:48.719><c> uh</c><01:29:48.920><c> establishment</c><01:29:49.880><c> but</c><01:29:50.880><c> um</c><01:29:51.480><c> maybe</c> current uh establishment but um maybe current uh establishment but um maybe someday<01:29:52.040><c> in</c><01:29:52.119><c> the</c><01:29:52.280><c> future</c><01:29:52.639><c> that's</c><01:29:52.800><c> interesting</c> someday in the future that's interesting someday in the future that's interesting well<01:29:54.080><c> why</c><01:29:54.239><c> not</c><01:29:54.520><c> actually</c><01:29:55.400><c> um</c><01:29:55.800><c> Trump's</c><01:29:56.239><c> been</c> well why not actually um Trump's been well why not actually um Trump's been talking<01:29:56.639><c> about</c><01:29:56.920><c> abolishing</c><01:29:57.600><c> income</c><01:29:58.040><c> tax</c><01:29:59.000><c> and</c> talking about abolishing income tax and talking about abolishing income tax and the<01:29:59.719><c> reasoning</c><01:30:00.199><c> behind</c><01:30:00.600><c> that</c><01:30:00.719><c> is</c><01:30:00.920><c> basically</c> the reasoning behind that is basically the reasoning behind that is basically with<01:30:01.560><c> the</c><01:30:01.679><c> amount</c><01:30:01.920><c> of</c><01:30:02.440><c> money</c><01:30:02.760><c> printing</c><01:30:03.119><c> that's</c> with the amount of money printing that's with the amount of money printing that's happening<01:30:03.800><c> anyways</c><01:30:04.400><c> that's</c><01:30:04.679><c> already</c><01:30:05.080><c> an</c> happening anyways that's already an happening anyways that's already an effect<01:30:05.520><c> of</c><01:30:05.719><c> tax</c><01:30:06.239><c> so</c><01:30:06.639><c> people</c><01:30:06.840><c> are</c><01:30:06.960><c> just</c><01:30:07.119><c> getting</c> effect of tax so people are just getting effect of tax so people are just getting taxed<01:30:07.719><c> twice</c><01:30:08.080><c> so</c><01:30:08.280><c> if</c><01:30:08.360><c> you're</c><01:30:08.880><c> just</c><01:30:09.520><c> saying</c> taxed twice so if you're just saying taxed twice so if you're just saying you're<01:30:10.000><c> going</c><01:30:10.119><c> to</c><01:30:10.480><c> print</c><01:30:10.760><c> money</c><01:30:11.119><c> to</c><01:30:11.320><c> make</c><01:30:11.520><c> the</c> you're going to print money to make the you're going to print money to make the ends<01:30:11.960><c> meet</c><01:30:12.199><c> no</c><01:30:12.360><c> matter</c><01:30:12.679><c> what</c><01:30:13.280><c> what</c><01:30:13.440><c> this</c><01:30:13.639><c> does</c> ends meet no matter what what this does ends meet no matter what what this does is<01:30:14.159><c> it</c><01:30:14.520><c> just</c><01:30:14.840><c> makes</c><01:30:15.440><c> everybody</c><01:30:16.440><c> on</c><01:30:16.600><c> the</c><01:30:16.760><c> bottom</c> is it just makes everybody on the bottom is it just makes everybody on the bottom poor<01:30:18.080><c> basically</c><01:30:18.520><c> so</c><01:30:18.679><c> they're</c><01:30:18.840><c> getting</c><01:30:19.280><c> taxed</c> poor basically so they're getting taxed poor basically so they're getting taxed so so so yeah<01:30:22.400><c> Trump</c><01:30:22.639><c> is</c><01:30:22.840><c> actually</c><01:30:23.119><c> in</c><01:30:23.280><c> favor</c><01:30:23.560><c> of</c><01:30:23.719><c> that</c> yeah Trump is actually in favor of that yeah Trump is actually in favor of that he's<01:30:24.199><c> been</c><01:30:24.360><c> talking</c><01:30:24.719><c> about</c><01:30:25.280><c> um</c><01:30:25.679><c> how</c><01:30:26.320><c> I</c><01:30:26.440><c> think</c> he's been talking about um how I think he's been talking about um how I think income<01:30:27.679><c> tax</c><01:30:27.960><c> started</c><01:30:28.239><c> in</c><01:30:28.400><c> like</c><01:30:28.600><c> 1913</c><01:30:29.600><c> and</c><01:30:29.719><c> it</c> income tax started in like 1913 and it income tax started in like 1913 and it was<01:30:30.040><c> like</c><01:30:30.840><c> only</c><01:30:31.119><c> 10%</c><01:30:31.639><c> of</c><01:30:31.760><c> the</c><01:30:32.040><c> budget</c><01:30:32.560><c> back</c> was like only 10% of the budget back was like only 10% of the budget back then<01:30:33.119><c> maybe</c><01:30:33.440><c> far</c><01:30:33.719><c> less</c><01:30:33.960><c> and</c><01:30:34.400><c> it</c><01:30:34.560><c> ballooned</c> then maybe far less and it ballooned then maybe far less and it ballooned over<01:30:35.360><c> time</c><01:30:35.800><c> so</c><01:30:36.280><c> there's</c><01:30:36.560><c> other</c><01:30:36.800><c> ways</c><01:30:37.000><c> to</c><01:30:37.159><c> set</c> over time so there's other ways to set over time so there's other ways to set

but</c><01:31:44.719><c> what</c><01:31:44.880><c> I've</c><01:31:45.040><c> realized</c><01:31:45.679><c> is</c><01:31:45.840><c> that</c> this um but what I've realized is that this um but what I've realized is that AI<01:31:46.280><c> doomers</c><01:31:46.719><c> are</c> AI doomers are AI doomers are projecting<01:31:49.199><c> AI</c><01:31:50.280><c> onto</c><01:31:51.280><c> a</c><01:31:51.600><c> continuation</c><01:31:52.600><c> of</c> projecting AI onto a continuation of projecting AI onto a continuation of what<01:31:52.960><c> they're</c><01:31:53.159><c> feeling</c><01:31:53.960><c> from</c><01:31:54.280><c> the</c><01:31:54.840><c> corporate</c> what they're feeling from the corporate what they're feeling from the corporate growth<01:31:55.719><c> and</c><01:31:55.920><c> the</c><01:31:56.080><c> financial</c><01:31:56.560><c> pressure</c><01:31:56.880><c> that</c> growth and the financial pressure that growth and the financial pressure that they're<01:31:57.600><c> feeling</c><01:31:58.600><c> so</c><01:31:58.800><c> in</c><01:31:58.920><c> a</c><01:31:59.080><c> way</c><01:31:59.719><c> they</c><01:31:59.880><c> are</c> they're feeling so in a way they are they're feeling so in a way they are right<01:32:01.119><c> in</c><01:32:01.239><c> a</c><01:32:01.400><c> sense</c><01:32:01.880><c> that</c><01:32:02.360><c> if</c><01:32:02.960><c> corporations</c> right in a sense that if corporations right in a sense that if corporations were<01:32:03.840><c> allowed</c><01:32:04.080><c> to</c><01:32:04.199><c> grow</c><01:32:04.440><c> unchecked</c><01:32:05.080><c> the</c><01:32:05.199><c> way</c> were allowed to grow unchecked the way were allowed to grow unchecked the way that<01:32:05.520><c> they</c><01:32:05.960><c> are</c><01:32:07.360><c> um</c><01:32:08.360><c> that's</c><01:32:08.639><c> essentially</c><01:32:09.440><c> a</c><01:32:09.719><c> an</c> that they are um that's essentially a an that they are um that's essentially a an evil<01:32:10.440><c> AI</c><01:32:10.840><c> who</c><01:32:11.000><c> was</c><01:32:11.159><c> able</c><01:32:11.440><c> to</c><01:32:12.440><c> I</c><01:32:12.560><c> like</c><01:32:12.760><c> that</c><01:32:12.920><c> idea</c> evil AI who was able to I like that idea evil AI who was able to I like that idea of<01:32:13.239><c> yours</c><01:32:13.480><c> a</c><01:32:13.639><c> lot</c><01:32:14.639><c> that's</c><01:32:14.840><c> very</c><01:32:15.360><c> compelling</c><01:32:16.360><c> um</c> of yours a lot that's very compelling um of yours a lot that's very compelling um and<01:32:17.280><c> uh</c><01:32:17.400><c> so</c><01:32:17.679><c> basically</c><01:32:18.239><c> this</c><01:32:18.400><c> is</c><01:32:18.679><c> the</c><01:32:19.560><c> way</c><01:32:20.199><c> that</c> and uh so basically this is the way that and uh so basically this is the way that like<01:32:20.840><c> so</c><01:32:21.080><c> they</c><01:32:21.239><c> they</c><01:32:21.320><c> see</c><01:32:21.679><c> this</c><01:32:22.159><c> a</c><01:32:22.400><c> as</c><01:32:23.239><c> a</c><01:32:23.560><c>

much</c><01:32:25.239><c> predictive</c> thing that it has so much predictive thing that it has so much predictive power<01:32:26.199><c> it</c><01:32:26.639><c> can</c><01:32:27.639><c> um</c><01:32:28.480><c> determine</c><01:32:28.880><c> your</c><01:32:29.040><c> outcome</c> power it can um determine your outcome power it can um determine your outcome before<01:32:30.159><c> you</c><01:32:30.760><c> can</c> before you can before you can and<01:32:34.040><c> it's</c><01:32:34.400><c> the</c><01:32:34.639><c> the</c><01:32:34.880><c> the</c><01:32:35.040><c>

we</c><01:36:34.719><c> just</c><01:36:34.920><c> make</c><01:36:35.199><c> things</c><01:36:35.520><c> impenetrable</c> like we just make things impenetrable like we just make things impenetrable and<01:36:36.320><c> like</c><01:36:36.520><c> that's</c><01:36:36.760><c> health</c><01:36:37.040><c> insurance</c><01:36:37.600><c> right</c> and like that's health insurance right and like that's health insurance right like<01:36:38.000><c> we're</c><01:36:38.199><c> just</c><01:36:38.360><c> going</c><01:36:39.000><c> to</c><01:36:40.000><c> um</c><01:36:40.159><c> bury</c><01:36:40.480><c> you</c><01:36:40.600><c> in</c> like we're just going to um bury you in like we're just going to um bury you in complexity<01:36:41.480><c> until</c><01:36:41.760><c> you</c><01:36:41.920><c>

then<01:36:44.280><c> that's</c><01:36:44.480><c> how</c><01:36:44.600><c> we</c><01:36:45.239><c> win</c><01:36:46.239><c> um</c><01:36:47.440><c> so</c><01:36:48.440><c> with</c><01:36:49.360><c> a</c><01:36:49.480><c> lot</c> then that's how we win um so with a lot then that's how we win um so with a lot of<01:36:49.719><c> what</c><01:36:49.840><c> I'm</c><01:36:49.960><c>

uh</c><01:36:52.280><c> Industries</c><01:36:52.840><c> like</c><01:36:53.000><c> that</c><01:36:53.159><c> that</c> targeting uh Industries like that that targeting uh Industries like that that on<01:36:53.840><c> information</c> on information on information asymmetry<01:36:55.960><c> um</c><01:36:56.639><c> and</c><01:36:56.760><c> then</c><01:36:56.920><c> I</c><01:36:57.080><c> plan</c><01:36:57.719><c> to</c><01:36:58.760><c> uh</c> asymmetry um and then I plan to uh asymmetry um and then I plan to uh basically<01:37:00.159><c> just</c><01:37:00.320><c> make</c><01:37:00.480><c> it</c><01:37:00.639><c> really</c><01:37:00.920><c> easy</c><01:37:01.239><c> to</c> basically just make it really easy to basically just make it really easy to like<01:37:02.400><c> fight</c><01:37:02.719><c> back</c><01:37:02.920><c> against</c><01:37:03.159><c> that</c><01:37:03.280><c> because</c> like fight back against that because like fight back

out</c><01:46:06.960><c> of</c> basically getting more and more out of basically getting more and more out of the<01:46:07.280><c> time</c><01:46:07.520><c> of</c><01:46:07.960><c>
