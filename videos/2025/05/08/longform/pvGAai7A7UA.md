Um in a nutshell, a business business? Um in a nutshell, a business is<00:03:43.599><c> a</c><00:03:43.840><c> system</c><00:03:44.239><c> that</c><00:03:44.560><c> creates</c><00:03:44.959><c> value</c><00:03:45.280><c> in</c><00:03:45.519><c> a</c> is a system that creates value in a is a system that creates value in a repeatable<00:03:46.400><c> and</c><00:03:46.720><c> predictable</c><00:03:47.200><c> way.</c><00:03:47.920><c> So,</c> repeatable and predictable way. So, repeatable and predictable way. So, three<00:03:48.480><c> parts</c><00:03:48.720><c> of</c><00:03:48.799><c> that.</c><00:03:49.040><c> A</c><00:03:49.200><c> business</c><00:03:49.440><c> has</c><00:03:49.680><c> to</c> three parts of that. A business has to three parts of that. A business has to it's<00:03:50.480><c> a</c><00:03:50.640><c> system</c><00:03:50.879><c> that</c><00:03:51.120><c> has</c><00:03:51.280><c> to</c><00:03:51.760><c> create</c><00:03:52.080><c> value</c> it's a system that has to create value it's a system that has to create value and<00:03:52.560><c> it</c><00:03:52.720><c> has</c><00:03:52.799><c> to</c><00:03:52.879><c> do</c><00:03:52.959><c> it</c><00:03:53.120><c> repeatably</c><00:03:53.599><c> and</c> and it has to do it repeatably and and it has to do it repeatably and predictably.<00:03:55.040><c> Um</c><00:03:55.920><c> okay.</c><00:03:56.480><c> And</c> predictably. Um okay. And predictably. Um okay. And so<00:03:58.560><c> we</c><00:03:58.879><c> can</c><00:03:59.040><c> also</c><00:03:59.439><c> think</c><00:03:59.680><c> of</c><00:03:59.840><c> like</c><00:04:00.080><c> a</c><00:04:00.400><c> system</c><00:04:00.720><c> as</c> so we can also think of like a system as so we can also think of like a system as this<00:04:01.439><c> idea</c><00:04:01.840><c> that</c><00:04:02.159><c> anything</c><00:04:02.640><c> within</c><00:04:03.040><c> the</c> this idea that anything within the this idea that anything within the system<00:04:03.599><c> is</c><00:04:03.920><c> something</c><00:04:04.239><c> that</c><00:04:04.400><c> you</c><00:04:04.560><c> have</c> system is something that you have system is something that you have control<00:04:05.120><c> over.</c><00:04:05.840><c> And</c><00:04:06.080><c> so</c><00:04:06.239><c> your</c><00:04:06.480><c> business</c><00:04:06.799><c> is</c> control over. And so your business is control over. And so your business is what<00:04:07.200><c> you</c><00:04:07.360><c> have</c><00:04:07.599><c> control</c><00:04:08.040><c> over.</c><00:04:09.040><c> Anything</c> what you have control over. Anything what you have control over. Anything outside<00:04:09.920><c> the</c><00:04:10.239><c> system</c><00:04:11.040><c> is</c><00:04:11.519><c> outside</c><00:04:11.920><c> of</c><00:04:12.080><c> your</c> outside the system is outside of your outside the system is outside of your business<00:04:12.640><c> is</c><00:04:12.879><c> something</c><00:04:13.120><c> you</c><00:04:13.360><c> can</c><00:04:13.640><c> influence.</c> business is something you can influence. business is something you can influence.

And we're going to do that<00:05:18.800><c> by</c><00:05:19.680><c> making</c><00:05:20.000><c> sure</c><00:05:20.160><c> that</c><00:05:20.400><c> we</c><00:05:20.560><c> connect</c><00:05:21.039><c> with</c> that by making sure that we connect with that by making sure that we connect with the<00:05:21.600><c> people</c><00:05:21.759><c> that</c><00:05:21.919><c> we</c><00:05:22.160><c> need</c><00:05:22.240><c> to</c><00:05:22.400><c> connect</c><00:05:22.919><c> with.</c> the people that we need to connect with. the people that we need to connect with. Um<00:05:26.479><c> okay.</c><00:05:27.199><c> Uh</c><00:05:27.600><c> and</c><00:05:28.280><c> so</c><00:05:29.280><c> from</c><00:05:29.520><c> there</c><00:05:29.759><c> we</c><00:05:30.080><c> kind</c><00:05:30.320><c> of</c> Um okay. Uh and so from there we kind of Um okay. Uh and so from there we kind of went<00:05:31.199><c> into</c><00:05:31.680><c> a</c><00:05:31.919><c> little</c><00:05:32.000><c> bit</c><00:05:32.160><c> of</c><00:05:32.240><c> personal</c> went into a little bit of personal went into a little bit of personal discovery<00:05:33.120><c> because</c><00:05:33.840><c> you</c><00:05:34.160><c> are</c><00:05:34.320><c> the</c><00:05:34.479><c> core</c><00:05:34.639><c> of</c> discovery because you are the core of discovery because you are the core of your<00:05:35.080><c> business</c><00:05:36.080><c> and</c><00:05:36.800><c> this</c><00:05:37.039><c> is</c><00:05:37.199><c> an</c><00:05:37.440><c> idea</c><00:05:37.919><c> that</c> your business and this is an idea that your business and this is an idea that uh<00:05:39.759><c> is</c><00:05:40.240><c> at</c><00:05:40.400><c> the</c><00:05:40.560><c> heart</c><00:05:40.720><c> of</c><00:05:40.880><c> this</c><00:05:41.039><c> concept</c><00:05:41.360><c> I</c> uh is at the heart of this concept I uh is at the heart of this concept I call<00:05:41.680><c> the</c><00:05:41.919><c> personal</c><00:05:42.240><c> enterprise</c><00:05:42.800><c> and</c><00:05:42.960><c> this</c><00:05:43.120><c> is</c> call the personal enterprise and this is call the personal enterprise and this is how<00:05:43.360><c> I</c><00:05:43.600><c> run</c><00:05:43.759><c> my</c><00:05:44.000><c> life.</c><00:05:44.880><c> And</c><00:05:45.120><c> so</c><00:05:45.520><c> I</c><00:05:45.919><c> look</c><00:05:46.160><c> at</c><00:05:46.560><c> my</c> how I run my life. And so I look at my how I run my life. And so I look at my personal<00:05:47.360><c> life</c><00:05:47.759><c> as</c><00:05:48.400><c> the</c><00:05:48.720><c> CEO</c><00:05:49.720><c> of</c><00:05:50.720><c> the</c><00:05:51.039><c> business</c> personal life as the CEO of the business personal life as the CEO of the business that<00:05:51.600><c> is</c><00:05:51.840><c> my</c><00:05:52.280><c> life.</c><00:05:53.360><c> And</c> that is my life. And that is my life. And so<00:05:56.560><c> my</c><00:05:56.880><c> life</c><00:05:57.280><c> is</c><00:05:58.080><c> my</c><00:05:58.479><c> system</c><00:05:58.880><c> that</c><00:05:59.199><c> is</c><00:05:59.919><c> working</c> so my life is my system that is working so my life is my system that is working to<00:06:01.600><c> create</c><00:06:02.000><c> value</c><00:06:02.560><c> in</c><00:06:02.800><c> a</c><00:06:02.960><c> repeatable</c><00:06:03.520><c> and</c> to create value in a repeatable and to create value in a repeatable and predictable<00:06:04.520><c> way.</c><00:06:05.960><c> And</c><00:06:06.960><c> I've</c><00:06:07.280><c> actually</c><00:06:07.440><c> had</c><00:06:07.680><c> a</c> predictable way. And I've actually had a predictable way. And I've actually had a lot<00:06:07.919><c> of</c><00:06:08.080><c> trouble</c><00:06:08.479><c> with</c><00:06:08.720><c> the</c><00:06:09.039><c> predictable</c><00:06:09.680><c> part</c> lot of trouble with the predictable part lot of trouble with the predictable part um<00:06:11.440><c> because</c><00:06:11.759><c> the</c><00:06:12.000><c> repeatable</c><00:06:12.560><c> part</c><00:06:12.880><c> bores</c><00:06:13.400><c> me.</c> um because the repeatable part bores me. um because the repeatable part bores me. And<00:06:14.639><c> so</c><00:06:15.120><c> in</c><00:06:15.440><c> software</c><00:06:15.840><c> engineering</c><00:06:16.479><c> you</c><00:06:16.720><c> can</c> And so in software engineering you can And so in software engineering you can just<00:06:17.039><c> kind</c><00:06:17.199><c> of</c><00:06:17.360><c> automate</c><00:06:17.759><c> that,</c><00:06:18.160><c> right?</c><00:06:18.400><c> And</c> just kind of automate that, right? And just kind of automate that, right? And you<00:06:18.720><c> automate</c><00:06:19.039><c> the</c><00:06:19.280><c> repeatable</c><00:06:19.680><c> parts.</c><00:06:20.000><c> And</c> you automate the repeatable parts. And you automate the repeatable parts. And that's<00:06:20.880><c> why</c><00:06:21.199><c> software</c><00:06:21.600><c> engineers</c><00:06:22.080><c> are</c> that's why software engineers are that's why software engineers are notoriously<00:06:22.960><c> known</c><00:06:23.280><c> to</c><00:06:23.520><c> be</c><00:06:23.680><c> lazy.</c><00:06:24.319><c> We</c><00:06:24.560><c> we</c> notoriously known to be lazy. We we notoriously known to be lazy. We we don't<00:06:25.039><c> want</c><00:06:25.199><c> to</c><00:06:25.280><c> do</c><00:06:25.440><c> the</c><00:06:25.600><c> same</c><00:06:25.759><c> thing</c><00:06:26.360><c> twice.</c> don't want to do the same thing twice. don't want to do the same thing twice. Um<00:06:29.199><c> but</c><00:06:29.440><c> that's</c><00:06:29.759><c> not</c><00:06:29.919><c> always</c><00:06:30.160><c> possible</c><00:06:30.720><c> in</c> Um but that's not always possible in Um but that's not always possible in business.<00:06:31.840><c> And</c><00:06:32.000><c> so</c><00:06:32.319><c> if</c><00:06:32.479><c> you're</c><00:06:32.639><c> a</c><00:06:32.800><c> software</c> business. And so if you're a software business. And so if you're a software engineer<00:06:33.520><c> who's</c><00:06:33.840><c> coming</c><00:06:34.000><c> into</c><00:06:34.400><c> business,</c> engineer who's coming into business, engineer who's coming into business, um<00:06:37.280><c> we</c><00:06:37.600><c> need</c><00:06:37.680><c> to</c><00:06:37.840><c> realize</c><00:06:38.319><c> that</c> um we need to realize that um we need to realize that like<00:06:40.639><c> you</c><00:06:40.880><c> don't</c><00:06:41.039><c> always</c><00:06:41.360><c> have</c><00:06:41.520><c> that</c><00:06:41.759><c> option</c> like you don't always have that option like you don't always have that option to<00:06:42.759><c> automate</c><00:06:43.759><c> and</c><00:06:44.000><c> in</c><00:06:44.240><c> fact</c><00:06:44.880><c> you</c><00:06:45.120><c> really</c> to automate and in fact you really to automate and in fact you really shouldn't<00:06:46.160><c> because</c><00:06:46.479><c> you</c><00:06:46.720><c> don't</c><00:06:46.880><c> know</c><00:06:46.960><c> what</c><00:06:47.199><c> to</c> shouldn't because you don't know what to shouldn't because you don't know what to automate<00:06:47.680><c> yet.</c><00:06:48.639><c> Um,</c><00:06:49.440><c> and</c><00:06:49.680><c> so</c><00:06:50.080><c> if</c><00:06:50.319><c> you're</c> automate yet. Um, and so if you're automate yet. Um, and so if you're coming<00:06:50.639><c> in</c><00:06:50.880><c> with</c><00:06:51.039><c> this</c><00:06:51.280><c> builder</c><00:06:51.600><c> background,</c> coming in with this builder background, coming in with this builder background, uh,<00:06:52.800><c> and</c><00:06:52.960><c> kind</c><00:06:53.120><c> of</c><00:06:53.199><c> knowing</c><00:06:53.440><c> what</c><00:06:53.680><c> to</c><00:06:53.840><c> do,</c><00:06:54.160><c> it's</c> uh, and kind of knowing what to do, it's uh, and kind of knowing what to do, it's really<00:06:54.639><c> easy</c><00:06:54.880><c> to</c><00:06:55.039><c> get</c><00:06:55.199><c> stuck</c> really easy to get stuck really easy to get stuck in<00:06:57.520><c> what</c><00:06:57.759><c> I'm</c><00:06:58.000><c> going</c><00:06:58.160><c> to</c><00:06:58.319><c> build.</c><00:06:59.199><c> And</c><00:06:59.520><c> the</c> in what I'm going to build.
