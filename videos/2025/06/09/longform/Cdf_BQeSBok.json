And so what I've<00:42:38.960><c> started</c><00:42:39.280><c> looking</c><00:42:39.520><c> at</c><00:42:39.760><c> now</c><00:42:40.160><c> is</c><00:42:40.400><c> that</c> I've started looking at now is that I've started looking at now is that there<00:42:40.800><c> is</c><00:42:41.200><c> actually</c><00:42:41.680><c> an</c><00:42:41.920><c> organizational</c> there is actually an organizational there is actually an organizational system<00:42:43.119><c> design</c><00:42:43.599><c> that</c><00:42:43.920><c> allows</c><00:42:44.240><c> us</c><00:42:44.560><c> to</c><00:42:45.920><c> um</c><00:42:46.319><c> have</c> system design that allows us to um have system design that allows us to um have a<00:42:46.880><c> fast</c><00:42:47.119><c> and</c><00:42:47.440><c> slow</c><00:42:47.680><c> lane.</c><00:42:48.079><c> So</c><00:42:48.319><c> you</c><00:42:48.480><c> give</c><00:42:48.800><c> people</c> a fast and slow lane. So you give people a fast and slow lane.

Um because sometimes in moving as fast. Um because sometimes people<00:43:03.839><c> are</c><00:43:04.000><c> just</c><00:43:04.400><c> stable</c><00:43:04.720><c> and</c><00:43:04.960><c> happy</c><00:43:05.200><c> and</c> people are just stable and happy and people are just stable and happy and they<00:43:05.599><c> don't</c><00:43:05.760><c> need</c><00:43:06.000><c> more</c><00:43:06.240><c> and</c><00:43:06.480><c> that's</c><00:43:06.720><c> what</c><00:43:06.880><c> we</c> they don't need more and that's what we they don't need more and that's what we need<00:43:07.119><c> to</c><00:43:07.280><c> be</c><00:43:07.440><c> rewarding</c><00:43:08.000><c> more</c><00:43:08.240><c> of.</c><00:43:09.200><c> But</c> need to be rewarding more of.

And so we have these systems that great. And so we have these systems that then<00:43:24.240><c> lead</c><00:43:24.480><c> to</c><00:43:24.920><c> initification</c><00:43:25.920><c> because</c><00:43:26.720><c> the</c> then lead to initification because the then lead to initification because the things<00:43:27.200><c> that</c><00:43:27.359><c> worked</c><00:43:27.599><c> in</c><00:43:27.760><c> the</c><00:43:27.920><c> beginning</c> things that worked in the beginning things that worked in the beginning don't<00:43:28.800><c> work</c><00:43:29.040><c> in</c><00:43:29.200><c> the</c><00:43:29.359><c> end</c><00:43:29.599><c> in</c><00:43:29.839><c> these</c><00:43:30.160><c> complex</c> don't work in the end in these complex don't work in the end in these complex systems<00:43:31.119><c> that</c><00:43:32.160><c> um</c><00:43:32.640><c> end</c><00:43:32.880><c> up</c><00:43:33.680><c> rewarding</c><00:43:34.240><c> what</c> systems that um end up rewarding what systems that um end up rewarding what I've<00:43:34.640><c> deemed</c><00:43:34.960><c> complexity</c><00:43:35.520><c> inflation.</c> I've deemed complexity inflation.

Um and then I've got auler<01:17:31.840><c> here</c><01:17:32.000><c> that</c><01:17:32.400><c> like</c><01:17:32.800><c> picks</c><01:17:33.040><c> it</c><01:17:33.199><c> up</c><01:17:33.360><c> and</c> auler here that like picks it up and auler here that like picks it up and processes<01:17:34.159><c> them</c><01:17:34.239><c> in</c><01:17:34.400><c> a</c><01:17:34.560><c> queue.</c><01:17:35.360><c> Um</c><01:17:35.840><c> and</c><01:17:36.080><c> so</c><01:17:36.719><c> it</c> processes them in a queue. Um and so it processes them in a queue. Um and so it uh<01:17:37.520><c> you</c><01:17:37.679><c> know</c><01:17:37.760><c> gets</c><01:17:38.000><c> the</c><01:17:38.239><c> request</c><01:17:39.280><c> um</c> uh you know gets the request um uh you know gets the request um basically<01:17:39.920><c> marks</c><01:17:40.239><c> it</c><01:17:40.480><c> that</c><01:17:40.800><c> it</c><01:17:41.120><c> is</c><01:17:41.440><c> being</c><01:17:42.719><c> um</c> basically marks it that it is being um basically marks it that it is being um worked<01:17:43.600><c> on</c><01:17:43.920><c> so</c><01:17:44.159><c> that</c><01:17:44.400><c> the</c><01:17:44.640><c> next</c><01:17:44.880><c> run</c><01:17:45.120><c> that</c> worked on so that the next run that worked on so that the next run that comes<01:17:45.760><c> along</c><01:17:46.000><c> in</c><01:17:46.239><c> 30</c><01:17:46.480><c> seconds</c><01:17:46.880><c> won't</c><01:17:47.199><c> pick</c><01:17:47.360><c> up</c> comes along in 30 seconds won't pick up comes along in 30 seconds won't pick up the<01:17:47.760><c> same</c><01:17:47.920><c> run.</c><01:17:48.800><c> Um</c><01:17:49.760><c> then</c><01:17:50.000><c> we</c><01:17:50.239><c> go</c><01:17:50.320><c> ahead</c><01:17:50.719><c> and</c> the same run.
