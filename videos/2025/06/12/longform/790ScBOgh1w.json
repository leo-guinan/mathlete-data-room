Um, and<00:10:23.920><c> they</c><00:10:24.480><c> figured</c><00:10:24.800><c> out</c><00:10:24.959><c> a</c><00:10:25.200><c> way</c><00:10:25.279><c> to</c><00:10:25.519><c> like</c><00:10:25.839><c> align</c> and they figured out a way to like align and they figured out a way to like align incentives<00:10:27.760><c> for</c><00:10:28.000><c> a</c><00:10:28.240><c> shared</c><00:10:29.200><c> target</c><00:10:30.399><c> in</c><00:10:30.720><c> such</c><00:10:30.959><c> a</c> incentives for a shared target in such a incentives for a shared target in such a way<00:10:31.360><c> that</c><00:10:31.680><c> like</c> way that like way that like worked<00:10:34.399><c> way</c><00:10:34.720><c> better</c><00:10:35.040><c> than</c><00:10:35.760><c> existing</c><00:10:36.640><c> models.</c> worked way better than existing models. worked way better than existing models.

Um, and so in Silicon<00:10:51.040><c> Valley,</c><00:10:51.440><c> this</c><00:10:51.600><c> actually</c><00:10:51.839><c> had</c><00:10:52.079><c> a</c> Silicon Valley, this actually had a Silicon Valley, this actually had a really<00:10:52.880><c> bizarre</c><00:10:53.600><c> impact.</c><00:10:54.880><c> Um,</c><00:10:55.440><c> and</c><00:10:55.680><c> you</c><00:10:55.839><c> can</c> really bizarre impact.

Um,<00:15:58.079><c> and</c><00:15:58.320><c> so</c><00:15:59.279><c> the</c><00:15:59.680><c> discovery</c><00:16:00.399><c> time</c><00:16:01.839><c> is</c><00:16:02.480><c> way</c> Um, and so the discovery time is way Um, and so the discovery time is way more<00:16:03.040><c> than</c><00:16:03.199><c> the</c><00:16:03.360><c> verification</c><00:16:04.000><c> time</c><00:16:04.320><c> because</c> more than the verification time because more than the verification time because we<00:16:05.040><c> don't</c><00:16:05.360><c> know</c><00:16:06.720><c> if</c><00:16:07.040><c> there's</c><00:16:07.360><c> a</c><00:16:07.680><c> an</c><00:16:08.000><c> answer,</c> we don't know if there's a an answer, we don't know if there's a an answer, right?<00:16:09.360><c> Um,</c><00:16:10.480><c> and</c><00:16:11.279><c> when</c><00:16:11.600><c> we</c><00:16:11.839><c> don't</c><00:16:12.000><c> know</c><00:16:12.160><c> if</c> right? Um, and when we don't know if right? Um, and when we don't know if there's<00:16:12.560><c> an</c><00:16:12.800><c> answer,</c><00:16:14.079><c> it's</c><00:16:14.480><c> really</c><00:16:14.800><c> hard</c><00:16:15.040><c> to</c> there's an answer, it's really hard to there's an answer, it's really hard to run<00:16:15.440><c> a</c><00:16:15.759><c> computer</c><00:16:16.079><c> to</c><00:16:16.320><c> go</c><00:16:16.480><c> find</c><00:16:16.720><c> that</c><00:16:16.959><c> answer.</c> run a computer to go find that answer. run a computer to go find that answer. Okay.<00:16:19.600><c> So</c><00:16:20.320><c> the</c><00:16:20.639><c> other</c><00:16:21.440><c> like</c><00:16:21.839><c> temporal</c><00:16:22.399><c> state</c><00:16:22.560><c> a</c> Okay. So the other like temporal state a Okay. So the other like temporal state a problem<00:16:23.120><c> can</c><00:16:23.279><c> be</c><00:16:23.440><c> in</c><00:16:24.000><c> is</c><00:16:24.639><c> a</c><00:16:24.959><c> temporal</c><00:16:25.440><c> p</c><00:16:25.759><c> state</c> problem can be in is a temporal p state problem can be in is a temporal p state which<00:16:26.240><c> is</c><00:16:26.480><c> if</c><00:16:26.800><c> there's</c><00:16:27.040><c> an</c><00:16:27.279><c> algorithm</c><00:16:27.839><c> that</c> which is if there's an algorithm that which is if there's an algorithm that exists exists exists um<00:16:30.000><c> at</c><00:16:30.240><c> that</c><00:16:30.480><c> time</c><00:16:30.880><c> and</c><00:16:31.199><c> basically</c><00:16:31.680><c> like</c><00:16:32.000><c> we</c> um at that time and basically like we um at that time and basically like we can<00:16:32.480><c> know</c><00:16:32.720><c> the</c><00:16:32.959><c> execution</c><00:16:33.519><c> of</c><00:16:33.839><c> that</c><00:16:34.079><c> time</c> can know the execution of that time can know the execution of that time because<00:16:35.040><c> then</c><00:16:35.199><c> we</c><00:16:35.440><c> can</c><00:16:35.519><c> optimize</c><00:16:36.720><c> the</c><00:16:36.959><c> time</c><00:16:37.120><c> it</c> because then we can optimize the time it because then we can optimize the time it takes<00:16:37.519><c> to</c><00:16:37.680><c> run</c><00:16:37.920><c> that</c><00:16:38.079><c> algorithm</c><00:16:38.639><c> and</c><00:16:38.880><c> so</c><00:16:39.279><c> you</c> takes to run that algorithm and so you takes to run that algorithm and so you have<00:16:39.680><c> a</c><00:16:39.920><c> problem</c><00:16:40.320><c> solved</c><00:16:40.720><c> and</c><00:16:40.880><c> then</c><00:16:41.040><c> the</c><00:16:41.279><c> time</c> have a problem solved and then the time have a problem solved and then the time it<00:16:41.600><c> takes</c><00:16:41.759><c> to</c><00:16:41.920><c> solve</c><00:16:42.079><c> that</c><00:16:42.240><c> problem</c><00:16:42.480><c> is</c><00:16:42.720><c> always</c> it takes to solve that problem is always it takes to solve that problem is always going<00:16:43.279><c> down</c><00:16:43.519><c> over</c><00:16:43.839><c> time.</c><00:16:45.040><c> Um</c><00:16:46.079><c> and</c><00:16:46.320><c> then</c><00:16:47.120><c> so</c> going down over time. Um and then so going down over time. Um and then so this<00:16:49.680><c> means</c><00:16:49.920><c> that</c><00:16:50.160><c> there's</c><00:16:50.480><c> like</c><00:16:50.720><c> this</c> this means that there's like this this means that there's like this transition<00:16:51.920><c> event</c><00:16:52.959><c> with</c><00:16:53.600><c> human</c><00:16:54.160><c> problem</c> transition event with human problem transition event with human problem solvers<00:16:54.959><c> where</c><00:16:55.199><c> they</c><00:16:55.440><c> convert</c><00:16:55.680><c> a</c><00:16:55.920><c> problem</c> solvers where they convert a problem solvers where they convert a problem from<00:16:57.199><c> NP</c><00:16:57.920><c> into</c><00:16:58.320><c> P.</c><00:16:59.440><c> Um</c><00:17:00.480><c> and</c><00:17:01.040><c> there's</c><00:17:01.360><c> this</c> from NP into P. Um and there's this from NP into P. Um and there's this transition<00:17:02.160><c> event</c><00:17:02.880><c> which</c><00:17:03.120><c> is</c><00:17:03.360><c> like</c><00:17:04.480><c> the</c><00:17:04.880><c> time</c> transition event which is like the time transition event which is like the time that<00:17:05.679><c> a</c><00:17:05.919><c> problem</c><00:17:06.240><c> switches</c><00:17:06.720><c> from</c><00:17:06.880><c> NP</c><00:17:07.439><c> into</c><00:17:07.839><c> P.</c> that a problem switches from NP into P. that a problem switches from NP into P.

I'm a set of one and I problem solvers. I'm a set of one and I solved<00:17:16.160><c> the</c><00:17:16.480><c> PNP</c><00:17:17.199><c> problem.</c><00:17:18.480><c> So</c><00:17:18.720><c> the</c><00:17:18.959><c> PNP</c> solved the PNP problem. So the PNP solved the PNP problem. So the PNP problem<00:17:20.799><c> transitioned</c><00:17:21.600><c> from</c><00:17:22.640><c> N</c><00:17:22.959><c> like</c><00:17:23.199><c> a</c> problem transitioned from N like a problem transitioned from N like a temporal<00:17:23.919><c> NP</c><00:17:24.400><c> state</c><00:17:24.720><c> to</c><00:17:24.880><c> a</c><00:17:25.120><c> temporal</c><00:17:25.600><c> P</c><00:17:25.919><c> state.</c> temporal NP state to a temporal P state. temporal NP state to a temporal P state.

Um and<00:19:19.679><c> so</c><00:19:20.640><c> now</c><00:19:21.919><c> we</c><00:19:22.240><c> actually</c><00:19:22.799><c> get</c><00:19:23.360><c> something</c> and so now we actually get something and so now we actually get something really<00:19:24.160><c> interesting.</c><00:19:25.280><c> Um</c><00:19:26.080><c> so</c><00:19:26.480><c> in</c><00:19:26.799><c> my</c><00:19:26.960><c> study</c><00:19:27.280><c> of</c> really interesting. Um so in my study of really interesting. Um so in my study of network<00:19:28.320><c> uh</c><00:19:28.880><c> relativity</c><00:19:29.919><c> we</c><00:19:30.160><c> have</c><00:19:30.320><c> this</c><00:19:30.480><c> thing</c> network uh relativity we have this thing network uh relativity we have this thing called<00:19:30.799><c> the</c><00:19:31.039><c> network</c><00:19:31.360><c> relativity</c><00:19:31.919><c> speed.</c><00:19:32.720><c> Um</c> called the network relativity speed. Um called the network relativity speed. Um and let's<00:19:39.600><c> see</c> let's see let's see I<00:19:42.000><c> have</c><00:19:42.080><c> something</c><00:19:42.320><c> planning</c><00:19:42.640><c> and</c><00:19:42.720><c> I</c><00:19:42.880><c> don't</c> I have something planning and I don't I have something planning and I don't know<00:19:43.120><c> what.</c> Oh,<00:19:46.640><c> there</c><00:19:46.799><c> we</c><00:19:47.039><c> go.</c><00:19:47.760><c> That's</c><00:19:49.200><c> okay.</c><00:19:50.240><c> Um</c><00:19:51.120><c> there</c> Oh, there we go. That's okay. Um there Oh, there we go. That's okay. Um there we<00:19:51.520><c> go.</c><00:19:51.760><c> That's</c><00:19:51.919><c> the</c><00:19:52.080><c> one</c><00:19:52.320><c> time.</c><00:19:52.880><c> Sorry</c><00:19:53.360><c> that</c> we go. That's the one time. Sorry that we go. That's the one time. Sorry that was<00:19:53.760><c> weird.</c><00:19:54.160><c> Um</c><00:19:54.640><c> all</c><00:19:54.720><c> right</c><00:19:55.039><c> cool.</c><00:19:55.600><c> So</c><00:19:56.000><c> we</c><00:19:56.320><c> have</c> was weird. Um all right cool. So we have was weird. Um all right cool. So we have this<00:19:57.280><c> um</c> this um this um discovery<00:19:59.919><c> verification</c><00:20:00.640><c> coupling.</c><00:20:01.120><c> So</c><00:20:01.280><c> the</c> discovery verification coupling. So the discovery verification coupling. So the this<00:20:01.760><c> network</c><00:20:02.000><c> invariant</c><00:20:02.559><c> speed</c><00:20:02.880><c> and</c><00:20:03.039><c> and</c> this network invariant speed and and this network invariant speed and and what<00:20:03.600><c> this</c><00:20:03.840><c> means</c><00:20:04.080><c> is</c><00:20:04.400><c> that</c><00:20:05.440><c> there</c><00:20:05.760><c> is</c><00:20:06.799><c> the</c> what this means is that there is the what this means is that there is the time<00:20:07.360><c> it</c><00:20:07.600><c> takes</c><00:20:08.000><c> between</c><00:20:09.039><c> when</c><00:20:09.280><c> a</c><00:20:09.520><c> problem</c><00:20:09.760><c> is</c> time it takes between when a problem is time it takes between when a problem is solved<00:20:10.799><c> to</c><00:20:11.039><c> like</c><00:20:11.840><c> where</c><00:20:12.320><c> it</c><00:20:12.559><c> is</c><00:20:12.960><c> validated</c><00:20:13.520><c> in</c> solved to like where it is validated in solved to like where it is validated in the<00:20:14.000><c> network</c><00:20:14.480><c> and</c><00:20:14.720><c> then</c><00:20:14.880><c> is</c><00:20:15.120><c> able</c><00:20:15.360><c> to</c><00:20:15.520><c> be</c><00:20:15.760><c> used</c> the network and then is able to be used the network and then is able to be used to<00:20:16.480><c> solve</c><00:20:17.760><c> downstream</c><00:20:19.200><c> um</c><00:20:19.600><c> things.</c><00:20:20.559><c> And</c><00:20:20.880><c> so</c> to solve downstream um things. And so to solve downstream um things. And so when<00:20:22.240><c> we</c><00:20:22.480><c> look</c><00:20:22.880><c> at</c><00:20:23.760><c> the</c><00:20:23.919><c> the</c><00:20:24.320><c> network</c> when we look at the the network when we look at the the network invariant<00:20:25.280><c> speed,</c><00:20:25.840><c> this</c><00:20:26.000><c> is</c><00:20:26.559><c> uh</c><00:20:26.880><c> very</c><00:20:27.200><c> similar</c> invariant speed, this is uh very similar invariant speed, this is uh very similar to<00:20:27.600><c> the</c><00:20:27.760><c> speed</c><00:20:27.919><c> of</c><00:20:28.000><c> light</c><00:20:28.159><c> in</c><00:20:28.400><c> physics,</c><00:20:28.799><c> right?</c> to the speed of light in physics, right? to the speed of light in physics, right? It's<00:20:29.679><c> the</c><00:20:29.919><c> idea</c><00:20:30.159><c> that</c><00:20:30.480><c> like</c><00:20:30.799><c> you</c><00:20:31.120><c> can't</c> It's the idea that like you can't It's the idea that like you can't observe<00:20:32.000><c> something</c><00:20:32.400><c> that</c><00:20:32.640><c> is</c><00:20:32.960><c> moving</c><00:20:33.360><c> faster</c> observe something that is moving faster observe something that is moving faster than<00:20:34.080><c> your</c><00:20:34.320><c> ability</c><00:20:34.880><c> to</c><00:20:35.280><c> like</c><00:20:36.240><c> sample</c><00:20:36.640><c> it.</c><00:20:37.440><c> So,</c> than your ability to like sample it. So, than your ability to like sample it. So, if<00:20:37.760><c> you</c><00:20:37.919><c> have</c><00:20:38.000><c> something</c><00:20:38.159><c> moving</c><00:20:38.480><c> faster</c><00:20:38.720><c> than</c> if you have something moving faster than if you have something moving faster than the<00:20:38.960><c> speed</c><00:20:39.120><c> of</c><00:20:39.280><c> light,</c><00:20:40.720><c> you</c><00:20:41.039><c> can't</c><00:20:41.360><c> track</c> the speed of light, you can't track the speed of light, you can't track where<00:20:41.840><c> it's</c><00:20:42.080><c> going</c><00:20:42.480><c> because</c><00:20:43.679><c> everything</c><00:20:44.159><c> you</c> where it's going because everything you where it's going because everything you see<00:20:45.200><c> from</c><00:20:45.440><c> it</c><00:20:45.679><c> is</c><00:20:46.080><c> further</c><00:20:46.559><c> away</c><00:20:48.000><c> um</c><00:20:48.240><c> than</c><00:20:48.480><c> it</c> see from it is further away um than it see from it is further away um than it was<00:20:49.200><c> when</c><00:20:49.760><c> the</c><00:20:50.000><c> light</c><00:20:51.039><c> hit</c><00:20:51.280><c> it</c><00:20:51.440><c> and</c><00:20:51.679><c> bounced</c> was when the light hit it and bounced was when the light hit it and bounced back,<00:20:52.320><c> right?</c><00:20:52.559><c> And</c><00:20:52.640><c> and</c><00:20:52.960><c> so</c><00:20:53.120><c> you</c><00:20:53.360><c> have</c><00:20:53.520><c> this</c> back, right? And and so you have this back, right? And and so you have this like<00:20:54.799><c> delayed</c><00:20:55.280><c> effect.</c><00:20:56.080><c> And</c><00:20:56.240><c> this</c><00:20:56.480><c> is</c><00:20:56.640><c> exactly</c> like delayed effect. And this is exactly like delayed effect. And this is exactly what<00:20:57.200><c> we're</c><00:20:57.440><c> seeing</c><00:20:57.760><c> like</c><00:20:58.000><c> with</c><00:20:58.240><c> Silicon</c> what we're seeing like with Silicon what we're seeing like with Silicon Valley.<00:20:59.360><c> They're</c><00:20:59.600><c> at</c><00:20:59.760><c> the</c><00:20:59.840><c> forefront</c><00:21:00.240><c> of</c> Valley.

And so whatever reality is universe. And so whatever reality is that<00:23:32.480><c> you</c><00:23:32.640><c> want</c><00:23:32.720><c> to</c><00:23:32.880><c> define</c><00:23:33.360><c> because</c><00:23:33.600><c> that's</c> that you want to define because that's that you want to define because that's just<00:23:34.080><c> like</c><00:23:34.240><c> the</c><00:23:34.480><c> sum</c><00:23:34.640><c> of</c><00:23:34.880><c> all</c><00:23:36.000><c> um</c><00:23:36.320><c> available</c> just like the sum of all um available just like the sum of all um available information.<00:23:38.000><c> And</c><00:23:38.240><c> so</c><00:23:38.400><c> what</c><00:23:38.559><c> you</c><00:23:38.720><c> can</c><00:23:38.799><c> do</c><00:23:38.960><c> is</c> information.
