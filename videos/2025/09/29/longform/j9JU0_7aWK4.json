  "description": "I have $40, a 630 credit score, and I'm about to speed run the economy using physics and rage.\n\nDay 1: Explaining Time Violence, making my first conscious market play, and why Silicon Valley is lying to you\n\n THE SITUATION\n\n- Bank account: $40\n- Credit score: 630\n- Debt: Bachelor's + Master's + half another Master's worth\n- Mission: Flip the entire economy by Christmas\n\nTHE THESIS\n\nTime Violence is the systematic theft of human consciousness through unnecessary complexity. \nEvery hour you spend on hold with insurance, every form you fill out three times, every process that takes 10 hours when it should take 10 minutes - that's not inefficiency, it's violence. And it's an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nWHAT I'M DOING\n\n1. Documenting my paper trading strategy using the Conscious Markets framework\n2. Proving that complexity arbitrage is thermodynamically inevitable\n3. Building the HumAIn Bottega - turning trauma survivors into founders who destroy the systems that broke them\n4. Making predictions about which companies will simplify or die\n\nTHE FIRST PLAY\n\nOpendoor (OPEN) - 200 shares, covered call at $10 strike, October 31st expiration\n\nWhy? Jane Street just took a 6% stake. They see what I see: the home buying process is pure Time Violence, and AI is about to collapse it.\n\nThis isn't financial advice. This is economic warfare documentation.\n\nKEY CONCEPTS\n\n- Time Violence Score (TVS) - measuring complexity theft\n- Conscious Markets - markets that acknowledge uncertainty and irreversibility\n- The Bottega Model - Renaissance workshop + AI = trauma to expertise pipeline\n- Complexity Arbitrage - profiting from the inevitable collapse of unnecessary bullshit\n- Physics Bitches - when in doubt, remember thermodynamics\n\n---\n\nTHE DOCUMENTS\n\nüìÑ HumAIn Bottega Manifesto: https://blog.ideanexusventures.com/manifesto/\n\nüìÑ Time Violence Formula: https://www.buildinpublicuniversity.com/the-universal-application-of-time-violence-an-inductive-proof/\n\nüìÑ Consciousness as Entropy Arbitrage: https://blog.ideanexusventures.com/consciousness-as-entropy-arbitrage-a-three-level-inductive-proof/\n\n---\n\nWHO THIS IS FOR\n\n- You're drowning in healthcare bureaucracy\n- You've spent hours on something that should take minutes\n- You suspect the economy is designed to waste your time\n- You're a founder who's tired of pretending you're \"innovative\"\n- You understand that revenge is a dish best served with compound interest\n- You believe in physics over marketing\n\nWHO THIS ISN'T FOR\n\n- People looking for get-rich-quick schemes\n- Anyone who thinks AI will replace human consciousness\n- Complexity parasites (you know who you are)\n- People who need things to be simple (this is sophisticated rage)\n\n---\n\nTHE PLAN\n\nWeek 1: Document the thesis, make predictions\n\nWeek 2: Launch the first products\n\nBy Christmas: New economy or die trying\n\n---\n\nFOLLOW THE SPEED RUN\n\nüé• This channel: Daily updates on the economic warfare\n\nüìß Newsletter: https://blog.ideanexusventures.com/ - Deep dives on Time Violence\n\nüê¶ Twitter: https://x.com/leo_guinan - Real-time play-by-play\n\nüíº LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-guinan-4211761bb/ - The professional version (still angry)\n\n---\n\nMENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO\n\n- Jim O'Shaughnessy / O'Shaughnessy Ventures\n- Kingman's Formula (queuing theory)\n- Landauer's Principle (thermodynamics of computation)\n- Maxwell's Demon (consciousness as state optimizer)\n- Jane Street (quantitative trading firm)\n- Opendoor (OPEN stock)\n- Emmett Shear / Win-Win Podcast / Liv Boeree\n\n---\n\nDISCLAIMERS\n\nNot financial advice. Not medical advice. Not legal advice. Not life advice. This is documentation of one person's attempt to arbitrage systemic complexity using physics, rage, and AI. All trades shown are paper trading until proven viable. Your mileage may vary. Past performance doesn't predict future results. The economy is a social construct and I'm deconstructing it.\n\nI'm not a licensed financial advisor, therapist, or anything else. I'm just someone who's tired of being poor while watching people profit from making life complicated.\n\nIf you're struggling, document it. Your suffering has value. Your survival is expertise. The freed become liberators.\n\n---\n\nSUPPORT THE MISSION\n\nThis content is free because information wants to be free and also I'm broke. If you want to support the speed run:\n\n- Subscribe and hit the bell (algorithmic warfare)\n- Share with someone drowning in complexity\n- Join the Bottega when it launches\n- Hire me to consult on your Time Violence Score\n- Wait until I'm rich and then I'll remember who was here on Day 1\n\n---\n\n**The economy is fucking broken. Let's burn it down and replace it with something conscious.**\n\nSee you tomorrow with some crazy new shit.\n\n*- Your friendly neighborhood economic terrorist*\n\n#TimeViolence #ConsciousMarkets #SpeedRunTheEconomy #PhysicsBitches #Bottega #ComplexityArbitrage",

I'm not 100% on that exactly<00:05:06.560><c> where</c><00:05:06.800><c> that</c><00:05:07.120><c> fits</c><00:05:07.360><c> into</c><00:05:07.680><c> the</c><00:05:07.919><c> analogy</c> exactly where that fits into the analogy exactly where that fits into the analogy writing,<00:05:08.800><c> but</c><00:05:09.440><c> uh</c><00:05:09.680><c> we'll</c><00:05:09.919><c> figure</c><00:05:10.080><c> that</c><00:05:10.240><c> out</c> writing, but uh we'll figure that out writing, but uh we'll figure that out later.<00:05:11.440><c> So,</c><00:05:12.720><c> the</c><00:05:13.039><c> idea</c><00:05:13.440><c> is</c><00:05:14.639><c> um</c><00:05:15.520><c> that</c><00:05:15.840><c> we</c><00:05:16.080><c> need</c> later. So, the idea is um that we need later. So, the idea is um that we need to<00:05:16.880><c> bring</c><00:05:17.039><c> the</c><00:05:17.199><c> BGA</c><00:05:17.759><c> back</c><00:05:17.919><c> and</c><00:05:18.160><c> we</c><00:05:18.320><c> need</c><00:05:18.400><c> to</c> to bring the BGA back and we need to to bring the BGA back and we need to have<00:05:18.880><c> conscious</c><00:05:19.360><c> markets.</c> have conscious markets. have conscious markets. Now,<00:05:21.360><c> let's</c><00:05:21.680><c> walk</c><00:05:22.000><c> through</c><00:05:22.880><c> what</c><00:05:23.919><c> a</c><00:05:24.240><c> conscious</c> Now, let's walk through what a conscious Now, let's walk through what a conscious markup<00:05:25.120><c> is.</c><00:05:25.759><c> And</c><00:05:26.080><c> so</c><00:05:26.320><c> basically</c> markup is.

So anyway,<00:10:23.360><c> I</c><00:10:23.600><c> applied</c><00:10:24.240><c> uh</c><00:10:25.279><c> via</c><00:10:26.160><c> a</c><00:10:26.640><c> newsletter</c><00:10:27.600><c> to</c> anyway, I applied uh via a newsletter to anyway, I applied uh via a newsletter to um<00:10:29.360><c> Jim</c><00:10:29.680><c> Onessy</c><00:10:30.160><c> and</c><00:10:30.399><c> Shaughnessy</c><00:10:30.800><c> Ventures</c> um Jim Onessy and Shaughnessy Ventures um Jim Onessy and Shaughnessy Ventures because<00:10:31.440><c> I</c><00:10:31.680><c> really</c><00:10:31.920><c> admire</c><00:10:32.320><c> everything</c><00:10:32.720><c> that</c> because I really admire everything that because I really admire everything that they're<00:10:33.040><c> doing</c><00:10:33.200><c> there.</c> they're doing there. they're doing there. Um,<00:10:34.959><c> and</c><00:10:35.200><c> actually</c><00:10:35.519><c> Jim</c><00:10:35.920><c> was</c><00:10:36.079><c> able</c><00:10:36.240><c> to</c><00:10:36.399><c> come</c> Um, and actually Jim was able to come Um, and actually Jim was able to come back<00:10:36.720><c> with</c><00:10:36.959><c> me</c><00:10:37.120><c> with</c><00:10:37.440><c> some</c><00:10:37.839><c> really</c><00:10:38.160><c> helpful</c> back with me with some really helpful back with me with some really helpful feedback<00:10:39.040><c> on</c><00:10:39.440><c> what</c><00:10:39.680><c> my</c><00:10:39.839><c> model</c><00:10:40.160><c> needed.</c><00:10:40.959><c> And</c><00:10:41.120><c> so</c> feedback on what my model needed. And so feedback on what my model needed. And so this<00:10:41.519><c> actually</c><00:10:41.760><c> gave</c><00:10:42.000><c> us</c><00:10:42.399><c> a</c><00:10:43.120><c> formula</c><00:10:43.600><c> for</c><00:10:43.839><c> time</c> this actually gave us a formula for time this actually gave us a formula for time violence.<00:10:44.880><c> And</c><00:10:45.120><c> so</c><00:10:45.519><c> let's</c><00:10:46.880><c> uh</c><00:10:47.600><c> we</c><00:10:47.920><c> can</c><00:10:48.640><c> go</c> violence. And so let's uh we can go violence. And so let's uh we can go ahead<00:10:49.920><c> and</c><00:10:50.640><c> pull</c><00:10:51.040><c> up</c><00:10:51.760><c> this.</c><00:10:52.320><c> And</c><00:10:52.480><c> so</c><00:10:52.800><c> basically</c> ahead and pull up this. And so basically ahead and pull up this. And so basically um<00:10:54.320><c> for</c><00:10:54.480><c> for</c><00:10:54.720><c> time</c><00:10:54.959><c> violence</c><00:10:55.360><c> specifically,</c> um for for time violence specifically, um for for time violence specifically, there<00:10:56.640><c> are</c><00:10:57.360><c> two</c><00:10:57.760><c> specific</c><00:10:58.320><c> pieces</c><00:10:59.040><c> that</c><00:10:59.440><c> we</c> there are two specific pieces that we there are two specific pieces that we have<00:10:59.760><c> to</c><00:10:59.920><c> deal</c><00:11:00.079><c> with.</c><00:11:00.880><c> Um</c><00:11:01.360><c> there's</c><00:11:01.680><c> the</c><00:11:01.839><c> the</c> have to deal with. Um there's the the have to deal with. Um there's the the operations<00:11:02.720><c> score</c><00:11:03.120><c> and</c><00:11:03.360><c> this</c><00:11:03.519><c> is</c><00:11:03.680><c> like</c> operations score and this is like operations score and this is like how<00:11:05.440><c> much</c><00:11:05.839><c> time</c><00:11:06.240><c> you</c><00:11:06.480><c> just</c><00:11:06.720><c> have</c><00:11:06.880><c> to</c><00:11:07.040><c> spend</c> how much time you just have to spend how much time you just have to spend dealing<00:11:07.760><c> with</c><00:11:08.000><c> a</c><00:11:08.240><c> system.</c><00:11:09.040><c> Um</c> dealing with a system. Um dealing with a system. Um and<00:11:11.360><c> this</c><00:11:11.680><c> is</c><00:11:11.839><c> based</c><00:11:12.240><c> off</c><00:11:12.800><c> of</c><00:11:13.440><c> Kingman's</c> and this is based off of Kingman's and this is based off of Kingman's formula,<00:11:14.399><c> which</c><00:11:14.560><c> is</c><00:11:14.640><c> something</c><00:11:14.880><c> that</c><00:11:15.040><c> that</c> formula, which is something that that formula, which is something that that Jim<00:11:15.519><c> was</c><00:11:15.680><c> able</c><00:11:15.920><c> to</c><00:11:16.720><c> um</c><00:11:17.200><c> show</c><00:11:17.440><c> me</c><00:11:17.680><c> as</c><00:11:18.079><c> a</c><00:11:18.959><c> normal</c> Jim was able to um show me as a normal Jim was able to um show me as a normal model<00:11:19.760><c> for</c><00:11:20.399><c> understanding</c><00:11:20.959><c> how</c><00:11:21.200><c> some</c><00:11:21.440><c> of</c> model for understanding how some of model for understanding how some of these<00:11:21.760><c> types</c><00:11:22.000><c> of</c><00:11:22.160><c> systems</c><00:11:22.720><c> are</c><00:11:23.120><c> judged</c><00:11:23.680><c> in</c><00:11:24.000><c> the</c> these types of systems are judged in the these types of systems are judged in the hedge<00:11:24.399><c> fund</c><00:11:24.640><c> world,</c><00:11:24.959><c> right?</c><00:11:25.839><c> And</c><00:11:26.720><c> so</c> hedge fund world, right?

And so<00:14:02.800><c> I</c><00:14:03.040><c> actually</c><00:14:03.279><c> realized</c><00:14:03.600><c> that</c><00:14:03.920><c> Open</c><00:14:04.240><c> Door</c><00:14:05.440><c> um</c> so I actually realized that Open Door um so I actually realized that Open Door um has<00:14:06.560><c> a</c><00:14:07.360><c> remarkably</c><00:14:08.240><c> good</c><00:14:08.720><c> setup</c><00:14:09.519><c> in</c><00:14:09.839><c> terms</c><00:14:10.320><c> of</c> has a remarkably good setup in terms of has a remarkably good setup in terms of current<00:14:11.680><c> market</c><00:14:12.000><c> position.</c><00:14:12.560><c> They</c><00:14:12.800><c> just</c> current market position. They just current market position. They just brought<00:14:13.279><c> in</c><00:14:14.000><c> uh</c><00:14:14.320><c> a</c><00:14:14.560><c> new</c><00:14:14.720><c> CEO.</c><00:14:15.360><c> They</c><00:14:15.600><c> brought</c><00:14:15.839><c> in</c> brought in uh a new CEO. They brought in brought in uh a new CEO. They brought in some<00:14:16.639><c> uh</c><00:14:17.279><c> like</c><00:14:17.519><c> the</c><00:14:17.760><c> previous</c><00:14:18.160><c> founders</c><00:14:18.639><c> to</c> some uh like the previous founders to some uh like the previous founders to the<00:14:19.040><c> board</c><00:14:19.680><c> and</c><00:14:20.000><c> basically</c><00:14:20.959><c> they're</c><00:14:21.279><c> going</c><00:14:21.519><c> AI</c> the board and basically they're going AI the board and basically they're going AI first.<00:14:23.360><c> And</c><00:14:24.160><c> so</c><00:14:24.880><c> I</c><00:14:25.360><c> worked</c><00:14:25.600><c> with</c><00:14:25.760><c> Claude</c><00:14:26.160><c> to</c> first. And so I worked with Claude to first. And so I worked with Claude to figure<00:14:26.480><c> out</c><00:14:27.360><c> what</c><00:14:27.760><c> a</c><00:14:28.079><c> bet</c><00:14:28.399><c> that</c><00:14:28.639><c> would</c><00:14:28.800><c> make</c> figure out what a bet that would make figure out what a bet that would make sense<00:14:29.839><c> based</c><00:14:30.240><c> off</c><00:14:30.480><c> of</c><00:14:30.720><c> the</c><00:14:30.959><c> conscious</c><00:14:31.360><c> market</c> sense based off of the conscious market sense based off of the conscious market framework<00:14:32.079><c> would</c><00:14:32.240><c> look</c><00:14:32.399><c> like.</c><00:14:33.519><c> And</c><00:14:34.480><c> so</c> framework would look like. And so framework would look like. And so um<00:14:36.399><c> how</c><00:14:36.560><c> I</c><00:14:36.800><c> set</c><00:14:37.040><c> this</c><00:14:37.600><c> up</c><00:14:37.920><c> was</c><00:14:38.240><c> basically</c><00:14:38.720><c> I</c><00:14:39.040><c> got</c> um how I set this up was basically I got um how I set this up was basically I got 200<00:14:39.839><c> shares</c><00:14:40.160><c> and</c><00:14:40.320><c> it's</c><00:14:40.480><c> all</c><00:14:40.639><c> paper</c><00:14:40.880><c> trading</c> 200 shares and it's all paper trading 200 shares and it's all paper trading because<00:14:41.440><c> I'm</c><00:14:41.680><c> poor.</c><00:14:42.560><c> Um</c><00:14:43.199><c> but</c><00:14:43.440><c> I'm</c><00:14:43.600><c> going</c><00:14:43.760><c> to</c> because I'm poor.

Um and so like if we look<00:15:37.120><c> at</c><00:15:37.279><c> this</c><00:15:37.519><c> so</c><00:15:37.760><c> there</c><00:15:37.920><c> is</c><00:15:38.079><c> a</c><00:15:38.240><c> very</c><00:15:38.480><c> specific</c> look at this so there is a very specific look at this so there is a very specific maximum<00:15:39.600><c> profit</c><00:15:40.000><c> I</c><00:15:40.240><c> can</c><00:15:40.320><c> make</c><00:15:40.480><c> on</c><00:15:40.720><c> this.</c><00:15:41.839><c> And</c> maximum profit I can make on this.

And so over the<00:21:05.520><c> past</c><00:21:05.840><c> week,</c><00:21:06.320><c> as</c><00:21:06.640><c> I,</c><00:21:07.200><c> you</c><00:21:07.360><c> know,</c><00:21:07.520><c> had</c><00:21:07.760><c> this</c> the past week, as I, you know, had this the past week, as I, you know, had this model<00:21:08.159><c> and</c><00:21:08.400><c> I've</c><00:21:08.559><c> started</c><00:21:08.880><c> doing</c><00:21:09.039><c> this,</c><00:21:09.919><c> I've</c> model and I've started doing this, I've model and I've started doing this, I've realized<00:21:10.400><c> that</c><00:21:10.559><c> we</c><00:21:10.720><c> can</c><00:21:10.880><c> actually</c><00:21:11.120><c> even</c><00:21:11.360><c> prove</c> realized that we can actually even prove realized that we can actually even prove this<00:21:12.159><c> at</c><00:21:12.480><c> three</c><00:21:12.799><c> different</c><00:21:13.120><c> layers.</c><00:21:13.360><c> So</c><00:21:13.520><c> we</c> this at three different layers. So we this at three different layers. So we can<00:21:13.840><c> start</c><00:21:14.080><c> at</c><00:21:14.320><c> the</c><00:21:14.559><c> like</c><00:21:14.720><c> the</c><00:21:14.880><c> thermodynamic</c> can start at the like the thermodynamic can start at the like the thermodynamic foundation<00:21:16.159><c> of</c><00:21:16.400><c> it.</c><00:21:17.200><c> Um</c><00:21:18.320><c> and</c><00:21:18.559><c> so</c><00:21:18.720><c> this</c><00:21:18.880><c> is</c><00:21:19.039><c> all</c> foundation of it. Um and so this is all foundation of it. Um and so this is all based<00:21:19.440><c> off</c><00:21:19.760><c> of</c><00:21:20.080><c> something</c><00:21:20.320><c> called</c><00:21:20.559><c> land</c><00:21:20.880><c> hours</c> based off of something called land hours based off of something called land hours principle<00:21:22.320><c> which</c><00:21:22.559><c> is</c><00:21:22.960><c> basically</c><00:21:23.520><c> that</c><00:21:23.840><c> to</c> principle which is basically that to principle which is basically that to delete<00:21:24.640><c> information</c><00:21:25.039><c> from</c><00:21:25.280><c> a</c><00:21:25.520><c> system</c><00:21:26.159><c> there's</c> delete information from a system there's delete information from a system there's a<00:21:26.720><c> minimum</c><00:21:27.280><c> cost</c><00:21:27.840><c> of</c><00:21:28.000><c> of</c><00:21:28.320><c> energy</c><00:21:28.720><c> that</c><00:21:29.039><c> you</c> a minimum cost of of energy that you a minimum cost of of energy that you have<00:21:29.520><c> to</c><00:21:30.720><c> pay</c><00:21:31.120><c> no</c><00:21:31.200><c> matter</c><00:21:31.600><c> what.</c><00:21:32.480><c> Um,</c><00:21:33.200><c> and</c><00:21:33.520><c> so</c> have to pay no matter what. Um, and so have to pay no matter what. Um, and so this this this means<00:21:37.440><c> there's</c><00:21:37.760><c> always</c> means there's always means there's always an<00:21:39.600><c> optimization</c><00:21:40.240><c> problem</c><00:21:40.720><c> in</c><00:21:41.039><c> place</c><00:21:41.360><c> because</c> an optimization problem in place because an optimization problem in place because you<00:21:41.919><c> have</c><00:21:42.000><c> to</c><00:21:42.400><c> minimize</c> you have to minimize you have to minimize the<00:21:44.559><c> the</c><00:21:44.960><c> total</c><00:21:45.360><c> energy</c><00:21:45.760><c> expenditure</c><00:21:46.400><c> for</c><00:21:46.640><c> a</c> the the total energy expenditure for a the the total energy expenditure for a given<00:21:47.200><c> system.</c><00:21:48.240><c> Um,</c><00:21:49.120><c> and</c><00:21:49.280><c> and</c><00:21:49.600><c> so</c><00:21:49.760><c> this</c><00:21:50.000><c> is</c> given system. Um, and and so this is given system. Um, and and so this is like<00:21:50.880><c> that</c><00:21:51.280><c> absolute</c><00:21:51.919><c> lowest</c><00:21:52.400><c> level.</c><00:21:53.440><c> Okay.</c> like that absolute lowest level. Okay. like that absolute lowest level. Okay. um<00:21:55.440><c> we</c><00:21:55.760><c> need</c><00:21:56.000><c> to</c> um we need to um we need to uh<00:21:58.559><c> and</c><00:21:58.799><c> so</c><00:21:58.960><c> what</c><00:21:59.120><c> we</c><00:21:59.200><c> actually</c><00:21:59.440><c> show</c><00:21:59.679><c> here</c><00:22:00.159><c> is</c> uh and so what we actually show here is uh and so what we actually show here is we<00:22:02.320><c> don't</c><00:22:02.480><c> want</c><00:22:02.640><c> to</c><00:22:02.799><c> collapse</c> we don't want to collapse we don't want to collapse uh<00:22:04.559><c> a</c><00:22:04.799><c> single</c><00:22:05.120><c> bit</c><00:22:05.360><c> in</c><00:22:05.600><c> a</c><00:22:05.919><c> superp</c><00:22:06.240><c> position</c> uh a single bit in a superp position uh a single bit in a superp position state<00:22:06.880><c> until</c><00:22:07.200><c> we</c><00:22:07.360><c> absolutely</c><00:22:07.840><c> have</c><00:22:08.000><c> to</c> state until we absolutely have to state until we absolutely have to because<00:22:08.640><c> once</c><00:22:08.960><c> we</c><00:22:09.120><c> collapse</c><00:22:09.520><c> it</c><00:22:09.840><c> there</c><00:22:10.080><c> is</c> because once we collapse it there is because once we collapse it there is energy<00:22:11.280><c> expanded</c><00:22:11.840><c> into</c><00:22:12.159><c> the</c><00:22:12.320><c> system</c><00:22:12.799><c> and</c><00:22:13.120><c> that</c> energy expanded into the system and that energy expanded into the system and that is<00:22:13.679><c> a</c><00:22:14.080><c> an</c><00:22:14.320><c> irreversible</c><00:22:15.120><c> process.</c><00:22:16.000><c> So</c><00:22:16.240><c> it</c> is a an irreversible process. So it is a an irreversible process. So it cannot<00:22:16.880><c> be</c> cannot be cannot be uh<00:22:18.640><c> reversed.</c><00:22:19.919><c> And</c><00:22:20.559><c> so</c><00:22:20.799><c> if</c><00:22:21.039><c> we</c><00:22:21.200><c> can</c><00:22:22.400><c> use</c> uh reversed. And so if we can use uh reversed. And so if we can use consciousness<00:22:23.360><c> to</c><00:22:23.600><c> hold</c><00:22:23.840><c> this</c><00:22:24.159><c> bit</c><00:22:24.559><c> in</c><00:22:24.960><c> superp</c> consciousness to hold this bit in superp consciousness to hold this bit in superp position<00:22:25.840><c> until</c><00:22:26.320><c> the</c><00:22:26.960><c> optimal</c><00:22:28.000><c> time</c><00:22:28.640><c> of</c> position until the optimal time of position until the optimal time of collapse, collapse, collapse, um<00:22:31.280><c> that's</c><00:22:31.520><c> where</c><00:22:31.760><c> things</c><00:22:32.000><c> start</c><00:22:32.080><c> to</c><00:22:32.240><c> get</c> um that's where things start to get um that's where things start to get interesting.<00:22:33.840><c> Now</c><00:22:35.280><c> um</c><00:22:36.720><c> what</c><00:22:36.960><c> we</c><00:22:37.120><c> can</c><00:22:37.200><c> do</c><00:22:37.360><c> is</c><00:22:37.520><c> we</c> interesting. Now um what we can do is we interesting. Now um what we can do is we can<00:22:37.840><c> actually</c><00:22:38.240><c> build</c><00:22:38.559><c> on</c><00:22:38.720><c> this</c><00:22:39.039><c> to</c><00:22:39.360><c> say</c><00:22:39.520><c> that</c> can actually build on this to say that can actually build on this to say that like like like oh<00:22:42.080><c> for</c><00:22:42.320><c> a</c><00:22:42.559><c> system</c><00:22:43.039><c> of</c><00:22:43.360><c> you</c><00:22:43.520><c> know</c><00:22:43.840><c> n</c><00:22:44.080><c> bits</c><00:22:45.360><c> we</c> oh for a system of you know n bits we oh for a system of you know n bits we need<00:22:46.320><c> to</c><00:22:46.480><c> minimize</c><00:22:46.960><c> the</c><00:22:47.120><c> total</c><00:22:47.440><c> entropy</c> need to minimize the total entropy need to minimize the total entropy through<00:22:48.400><c> selective</c><00:22:48.880><c> collapse</c><00:22:50.000><c> and</c><00:22:50.240><c> this</c> through selective collapse and this through selective collapse and this gives<00:22:50.640><c> us</c><00:22:50.799><c> the</c><00:22:51.039><c> idea</c><00:22:51.280><c> of</c><00:22:51.440><c> like</c><00:22:51.679><c> a</c><00:22:51.840><c> conscious</c> gives us the idea of like a conscious gives us the idea of like a conscious agent<00:22:52.880><c> that</c><00:22:53.120><c> can</c><00:22:53.360><c> collapse</c><00:22:53.840><c> a</c><00:22:54.320><c> subset</c><00:22:54.720><c> of</c><00:22:54.880><c> bits</c> agent that can collapse a subset of bits agent that can collapse a subset of bits um<00:22:57.280><c> in</c><00:22:57.600><c> like</c><00:22:58.320><c> the</c><00:22:58.559><c> known</c><00:22:58.880><c> and</c><00:22:59.039><c> unknown</c><00:22:59.520><c> states.</c> um in like the known and unknown states. um in like the known and unknown states. And<00:23:01.760><c> so</c><00:23:02.559><c> we</c><00:23:02.799><c> can</c><00:23:03.039><c> look</c><00:23:03.200><c> for</c><00:23:03.440><c> the</c><00:23:03.679><c> optimal</c> And so we can look for the optimal And so we can look for the optimal collapse<00:23:04.640><c> time</c><00:23:05.840><c> based</c><00:23:06.320><c> on</c><00:23:06.720><c> like</c><00:23:07.039><c> its</c> collapse time based on like its collapse time based on like its correlation,<00:23:08.080><c> the</c><00:23:08.320><c> energy</c><00:23:08.720><c> cost,</c><00:23:09.200><c> and</c><00:23:09.440><c> like</c> correlation, the energy cost, and like correlation, the energy cost, and like the<00:23:09.919><c> value</c><00:23:10.159><c> of</c><00:23:10.400><c> information</c><00:23:10.880><c> gained.</c><00:23:12.159><c> And</c><00:23:12.400><c> so</c> the value of information gained. And so the value of information gained. And so suddenly,<00:23:14.080><c> if</c><00:23:14.240><c> you're</c><00:23:14.480><c> familiar</c><00:23:14.720><c> with</c> suddenly, if you're familiar with suddenly, if you're familiar with Maxwell's<00:23:15.360><c> demon,</c><00:23:16.240><c> um</c><00:23:16.480><c> if</c><00:23:16.640><c> if</c><00:23:16.799><c> not,</c><00:23:16.960><c> you</c> Maxwell's demon, um if if not, you Maxwell's demon, um if if not, you should<00:23:17.200><c> look</c><00:23:17.280><c> it</c><00:23:17.360><c> up,</c><00:23:17.520><c> but</c><00:23:17.760><c> basically</c><00:23:18.240><c> the</c> should look it up, but basically the should look it up, but basically the conscious<00:23:18.799><c> agent</c><00:23:19.120><c> is</c><00:23:19.360><c> Maxwell's</c><00:23:19.840><c> demon</c><00:23:20.159><c> here,</c> conscious agent is Maxwell's demon here, conscious agent is Maxwell's demon here, trying<00:23:20.880><c> to</c><00:23:21.039><c> figure</c><00:23:21.200><c> out</c><00:23:21.440><c> where</c><00:23:22.159><c> that</c><00:23:22.320><c> that</c> trying to figure out where that that trying to figure out where that that line<00:23:22.960><c> is.</c><00:23:24.080><c> And</c><00:23:25.440><c> so</c><00:23:26.320><c> this</c><00:23:26.640><c> shows</c><00:23:26.880><c> us</c><00:23:27.039><c> that</c> line is. And so this shows us that line is. And so this shows us that consciousness<00:23:28.080><c> acts</c><00:23:28.960><c> as</c><00:23:29.280><c> like</c><00:23:29.440><c> an</c><00:23:29.679><c> exclusive</c> consciousness acts as like an exclusive consciousness acts as like an exclusive or<00:23:30.559><c> state</c><00:23:30.880><c> optimizer.</c><00:23:32.240><c> So</c><00:23:32.640><c> we're</c><00:23:33.600><c> maintaining</c> or state optimizer. So we're maintaining or state optimizer. So we're maintaining the<00:23:34.320><c> valuable</c><00:23:34.720><c> superp</c><00:23:35.039><c> positions</c><00:23:35.520><c> while</c><00:23:35.840><c> the</c> the valuable superp positions while the the valuable superp positions while the ones<00:23:36.240><c> that</c><00:23:36.400><c> don't</c><00:23:36.559><c> matter</c><00:23:36.880><c> we</c><00:23:37.120><c> just</c><00:23:37.280><c> collapse</c> ones that don't matter we just collapse ones that don't matter we just collapse down<00:23:37.760><c> and</c><00:23:37.919><c> get</c><00:23:38.080><c> rid</c><00:23:38.240><c> of,</c><00:23:38.559><c> right?</c><00:23:39.600><c> Um</c><00:23:40.400><c> and</c><00:23:40.720><c> so</c> down and get rid of, right? Um and so down and get rid of, right? Um and so from<00:23:41.840><c> here</c><00:23:42.080><c> we</c><00:23:42.320><c> can</c><00:23:42.480><c> actually</c><00:23:43.760><c> uh</c><00:23:43.919><c> build</c><00:23:44.240><c> into</c> from here we can actually uh build into from here we can actually uh build into the<00:23:44.720><c> understanding</c><00:23:45.120><c> of</c><00:23:45.280><c> like</c><00:23:45.600><c> time</c><00:23:45.919><c> violence</c> the understanding of like time violence the understanding of like time violence uh<00:23:46.799><c> you</c><00:23:46.960><c> know</c><00:23:47.200><c> as</c><00:23:47.440><c> entropy,</c><00:23:48.000><c> right?</c><00:23:48.400><c> So</c><00:23:49.360><c> this</c> uh you know as entropy, right? So this uh you know as entropy, right?
