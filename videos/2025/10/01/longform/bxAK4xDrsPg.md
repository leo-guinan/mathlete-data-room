**Description**:
THE SITUATION:
- Bank account: $40
- Credit score: 630  
- Debt: Significant
- Network: Worth more than all of that combined

THE REVEAL:
While I have $40 liquid, I got a $10,000 grant from the Open Research Institute to help launch a debt navigation platform. I'm not building alone - I have collaborators, partners, and a support system that makes this speed run possible.

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
- How I got a grant while broke
- The network I've been building behind the scenes
- Why intelligence is a function of networks, not individuals
- The real projects launching: Xelia (debt platform) and Yes Pen (consent protocol)
- How trust compounds faster than capital

THE PROJECTS:
Xelia: Collaborative debt refinancing platform (launching soon)
Yes Pen: Consent-first recording protocol for public LLM training
The Bottega: Navigator-founder studio (applications open)

This isn't about being a solo genius. It's about being connected to the right people at the right time with the right problems to solve.


THE WEEK AHEAD:
Day 1: Mission statement ‚úì
Day 2: Adjusted strategy ‚úì
Day 3: The network reveal (you are here)
Day 4: ???
Day 5: Week 1 results + what's next

---

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Network Capital over Financial Capital
- Intelligence = Networks, not individuals
- Trust compounds faster than money
- Navigators become founders
- The freed become liberators
