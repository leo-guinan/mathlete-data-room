I<00:05:47.759><c> wanted</c><00:05:48.000><c> it</c><00:05:48.160><c> to</c><00:05:48.240><c> be</c><00:05:48.320><c> a</c><00:05:48.560><c> universal</c><00:05:49.120><c> formula.</c> I wanted it to be a universal formula. I wanted it to be a universal formula. And<00:05:50.479><c> I</c><00:05:50.720><c> realized</c><00:05:51.039><c> that</c><00:05:51.280><c> the</c><00:05:51.440><c> universal</c> And I realized that the universal And I realized that the universal formula<00:05:52.320><c> is</c><00:05:52.479><c> that</c><00:05:52.720><c> it's</c><00:05:52.960><c> uniquely</c><00:05:53.440><c> you.</c><00:05:53.840><c> You</c> formula is that it's uniquely you. You formula is that it's uniquely you. You have<00:05:54.240><c> to</c><00:05:54.479><c> understand</c><00:05:55.120><c> what</c><00:05:55.360><c> makes</c><00:05:55.600><c> you</c> have to understand what makes you have to understand what makes you uniquely<00:05:56.320><c> you.</c><00:05:57.360><c> And</c><00:05:57.600><c> so</c><00:05:57.759><c> when</c><00:05:57.919><c> I</c><00:05:58.080><c> realized</c> uniquely you. And so when I realized uniquely you. And so when I realized that<00:05:59.600><c> I</c><00:05:59.759><c> knew</c><00:05:59.919><c> how</c><00:06:00.080><c> to</c><00:06:00.240><c> find</c><00:06:00.400><c> my</c><00:06:00.639><c> people.</c><00:06:01.199><c> And</c> that I knew how to find my people. And that I knew how to find my people.
