Time is different things to different people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2d06" name="2d06">Doctor Who described it as “People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint — it’s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly… time-y wimey… stuff.”</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="d0fd"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="b093" name="b093">And that might be the best description of all.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0d41" name="0d41">Time might also be way simpler. What if we throw out everything we know about time? And why can’t we?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6f46" name="6f46">Instead of time, let’s talk about a physical, measurable attribute. Let’s talk about potential energy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="49e7" name="49e7">What is potential energy? An object can store energy as the result of its position. (<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy" href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/energy/Lesson-1/Potential-Energy</a>). In a nutshell, potential energy is an idea of how much other energy can be generated by a certain object at a specific point in time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9a42" name="9a42">What happens when time advances by one tick (the unit doesn’t actually matter here)?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="137b" name="137b">Well, any number of things. Perhaps some of the energy gets converted to kinetic energy. Some gets lost as friction. Maybe some goes off into the ether. I don’t really care, and I don’t think anyone else should either.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="09f5" name="09f5">Why does it matter what happened? We know that the time changed, and our environment may have changed. The only way to know if it did is to make observations. When we make observations at a time t, we know some exact state at some exact moment.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="6a54"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="5ed5" name="5ed5">So, what if we stopped using time as a factor that we care about the specific value of? We don’t really know the future; we can only guess what the future might hold. We see some probability of the future. We just suck at understanding probability. Otherwise, lottery tickets would never sell.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3781" name="3781">So why not try to stop making problems harder than they should be? Focus on a goal, and pick something, anything, that might move you closer to your goal. We can’t control everything, but we can influence our own environment. We can increase the Potential Energy in our own lives by doing little things that gradually add up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b29" name="1b29">That is my idea of the concept of Zen. Do what you can in the moment. Understand that it does impact the future, but it does not guarantee the future. Any step can be taken at any point in time. If you don’t know where to go, take a step. In some direction, in any direction. And then see which way you are facing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6869" name="6869">So back to time. Maybe time is just a value that has some constant value in the past, and any number of possibilities in the future. “Any journey of a 1000 miles begins with a single step”. Take a step. Reassess the future probabilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="1cb0" name="1cb0">Why should you listen to me? Who am I? I am nobody. I am everybody. It doesn’t actually matter. I don’t want you to take my words based on my past accomplishments or lack thereof. I think I have made some positive changes in my life over the times that life changed drastically, and even though life is harder now than ever, I think I am in my best place ever. Maybe I am not; but I think I am, and I think I know why. Maybe these ideas are worth something, and maybe they are not. But publishing them was my step in a single direction. Let’s see what my environment looks like now.</p></div></div></section>
