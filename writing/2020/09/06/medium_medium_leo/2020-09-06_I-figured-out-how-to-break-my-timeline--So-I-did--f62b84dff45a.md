At this point, I am going to call it a Eureka moment. I thought I had figured out, at least intuitively, quantum physics and computing. Maybe I did, and maybe I didn’t. Look for my PhD publication and Nobel in the future if I did. But regardless, I did figure out something. I figured out how to influence my own timeline.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="b680"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="8e51" name="8e51">I have been struggling the past few years. Externally, I was relatively successful. Internally, I don’t think I can say that. I have pretty much always struggled with my weight. I have used a variety of nicotine products for the past few years. I had a tendency to drink until there wasn’t anything left to drink. Overall, I wasn’t very healthy, mentally or physically. I have, like most I am sure, bounced back and forth between spurts of healthy behaviors, but none of them stuck.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a204" name="a204">During this time, I also wasn’t particularly financially healthy. This is due to a number of reasons (as everything is), but when it came down to it, it was because I was avoiding some issues I had, and that typically doesn’t end well.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8584" name="8584">One thing I kept up pretty consistently. I read. I read a lot. I read articles, I read books, I read pretty much anything I could. One thing I do pride myself on is trying to open myself to as many new viewpoints as possible. So I was making sure to seek out those with much different life experiences than me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ca8d" name="ca8d">One idea resonated with me, and I ended up really making it work. The idea of making the smallest possible change you could, and building on that. I used this to slowly make changes in my life where I could. And I do mean small. I would decide to get up and walk to get something, instead of asking someone to get it who was up. Things like that. I really just celebrated every little internal success like I won the Super Bowl. I didn’t care when I didn’t do the right thing. I only focused on when I did.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="86cb"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="2c07" name="2c07">Then something started happening. I ended up dropping my nicotine habit. I stopped drinking soda as much. Then I eventually lost my caffeine addiction. I don’t think I can stress how big of a deal this was for me. I am someone who has a variety of coffee implements and a selection of super high caffeine coffees. I used to pound energy drinks like it was my job. This was really eye-opening for me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="9d1a" name="9d1a">I think a lot of this was actually made possible due to Covid. As weird as it sounds, being so cooped up all the time has lead me to some introspection. It almost made it unavoidable. It made it necessary to really mindfully do things throughout the day, or else you could drive yourself mad. That was really when I started to effusively self praise every time I caught myself doing something good.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="38a5"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--leading" id="6d23" name="6d23"><img class="graf-image" data-height="1301" data-image-id="1*MkD47JDBTXXPVrUqNum5nA.png" data-is-featured="true" data-width="1610" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MkD47JDBTXXPVrUqNum5nA.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">I broke my timeline.</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="45ce" name="45ce">So what does this have to do with quantum anything, or timelines? Everything, and nothing. One of my thinking processes went like this: “If I can make one small change, and have that lead to a positive outcome, what will happen if I take a few days, and do as many small things as I can think of?”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="efce" name="efce">It turns out, a whole lot. Some of the results were expected. Many were not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b8e7" name="b8e7">One of the things I decided to do was start writing. I started writing anything I could think of. I just let my brain flow. I reached out to people that I was close with, asking them if they would be willing to support various ideas in the future. I was trying to open up doors of possibilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3eef" name="3eef">And in doing so, something did in fact happen. My family essentially had an intervention for me. They told me I was exhibiting signs of mania, and since I do have a family history of bipolar disorder, they were concerned for me. This opened my eyes. I hadn’t even remotely considered that outcome. So what did I do? I agreed with them. I told them I did understand that I was exhibiting signs of mania, and that I would be happy to talk with anyone they wanted about it. I attempted to explain the ideas surrounding the experiment, which they listened to, although to varying degrees.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9ddb" name="9ddb">So, now I am almost a week into an intensive outpatient therapy program. It is mostly centered around group therapy, with specialists coming in as needed. And it has been quite possibly the best experience of my life so far. It has led to some complex emotions, mostly around how poorly I have communicated with those around me. The reason my behaviors didn’t make sense to anyone around me was because I didn’t actually let myself out around anyone else. I was so internally focused that I completely lost meaningful connections to the outside world.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8a95" name="8a95">But this also gives me an incredible amount of control in terms of my future. I have had open, honest discussions with some of my loved ones. And I have others planned. These are not easy discussions to have, but I am finding that a great weight lifts off me when I bring these discussions up. It is much easier to address a problem when everyone in the room can openly talk about the problem at hand.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="8897" name="8897">This ended up giving me some more insight as well. If I can cause this much chaos in the span of a week, what can we do when we focus on a shared goal? I think we have an immense amount of control over the direction of our future. But only if we all push all of our chaos in one direction. I want to reach out to anyone who is like-minded, anyone who really wants to change the world. For the first time, I really believe that I can change the world. For me to do anything else would be me not fulfilling my potential.</p></div></div></section>
