I expect that many feel the same way, but I don’t want to assume that. I have been battling with depression and anxiety for about a decade now. And I came out of it. For the first time in a decade, I don’t need any medication to help me manage my mental health. It gave me a perspective that I hope will help others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0cb1" name="0cb1">Before I address specific events in my past, I do want to start with some questions that I have started pondering recently. Thought experiments of sorts. One specifically drives the others: “What if everything we know is wrong?”</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="79de" name="79de"><img alt="shop window with #becurious" class="graf-image" data-height="3456" data-image-id="0*w95nv2YVO6xzkPJp" data-unsplash-photo-id="YG8rZ323UsU" data-width="5184" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*w95nv2YVO6xzkPJp"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@garybpt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@garybpt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Gary Butterfield</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="5abd" name="5abd">Starting with that question, I began to question everything. Why are things the way they are? It turns out, the answer is very easy if you think about it. The past has led to the current point in time. The events of the past are innumerable, but some events had bigger impacts in time than others. But the past is what the past is. We can’t change it. What about the future?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e38b" name="e38b">What about the future?</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="7d93"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="1634" name="1634">This is something that hit me hard. I realized that I had gotten so withdrawn into me own head, I never considered the futures of anyone outside of myself in real detail. And that led me to another consideration. I had never really asked people what they wanted their futures to be.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ab8e" name="ab8e">Why is that?</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="69e3"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="045f" name="045f">It occurred to me that I viewed the world around me as robots. I would provide input, they would give me some output, and I would move on. I never considered anyone else’s relationship to time and in relationship to my own time. Think about that for a moment. It isn’t easy to grasp, but once you get it, it’s hard to lose.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0417" name="0417">One of the things I have been doing while stuck in my head is breaking down every part of myself. I approached my brain like an engineering problem. I am just going to strip away layer after layer of why thoughts until I understand why I am who I am.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8fb8" name="8fb8">Thankfully, I have been lucky in life. I have the privilege of being able to do this on my own for the most part. I have just recently started therapy, and it really helped me understand how privileged I have been. So I stripped my past down to understand what made me me. I do not recommend this on your own if you have had a traumatic past. Find help before really getting into the darker parts of your life.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1a10" name="1a10">An interesting thing happened. I eventually got to the bottom. Or at least, close enough to the bottom that I decided to start building back up. And I started building back up while considering the futures of those around me, in addition to my own. And then my futures started changing. And I am ok with that. I am willing to sacrifice clarity of my own future for a less clear future with others while working toward a collective good.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="08ba" name="08ba">Time is interesting though, and every moment has an impact on something in future. And that doesn’t mean you need to understand what that impact will be. But by thinking of your actions in the present with the knowledge that they impact your futures, you can actually take control of your own life in the present. Maybe you can’t control all of your own futures in the moment. But if nothing else, you can make some part of some future more likely by an action now.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="c9bc" name="c9bc"><img alt="person on couch under sign saying proof" class="graf-image" data-height="4016" data-image-id="0*DnXsWMco8FttmCRv" data-unsplash-photo-id="7KsyY-Ed7B8" data-width="5147" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DnXsWMco8FttmCRv"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Austin Distel</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="ab98" name="ab98">I proved this to myself. I took small actions. If I couldn’t think of something to do, I had something I set myself to do automatically. One thing I found was that if I gave myself something to do every time I couldn’t think of something, I did a lot less of the things I didn’t like about myself. So I started drinking bottles of water. I told myself that if I didn’t have anything to do in a moment and I started wandering, I would just grab a bottle of water.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="2c31" name="2c31"><img alt="dummy appearing to stand over toilet" class="graf-image" data-height="3840" data-image-id="0*8VQ0lKIb5bqHhyA2" data-unsplash-photo-id="fcPNOln1d6Y" data-width="5760" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8VQ0lKIb5bqHhyA2"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@giorgiotrovato?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@giorgiotrovato?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Giorgio Trovato</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="b1e0" name="b1e0">I had to pee a lot. But also, it made it a lot easier to stop doing things I didn’t like doing. It started breaking the cycles I was letting myself get caught up in. And once I started breaking some cycles, there was a cascade effect. Cycles started breaking everywhere. And then my future became less clear, but also much brighter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8df9" name="8df9">So where am I now? I am a work in progress. But I feel truly happy for the first time in a long time. And I was able to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/i-figured-out-how-to-break-my-timeline-so-i-did-f62b84dff45a" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/i-figured-out-how-to-break-my-timeline-so-i-did-f62b84dff45a" target="_blank">break my timeline</a>. And I had, to me, a life-changing thought. Why didn’t I reach out for help earlier? And it was because I was looking for the map when I was already lost. We need to start addressing mental health not as optional, but as mandatory. It is just as important to get your mental health in line as it is your physical health.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5176" name="5176">Now for my other life-changing thought. What if we weren’t meant to deal with our thoughts on our own? What if humans at some point lost the ability to fully communicate with others, but their brains are wired to do exactly that. We all have shared experiences. But why should anyone have to learn something that someone else already has? If we freely communicate, we get to clearly discuss thoughts and feelings as we have them. Then things don’t build up. I think the key to better mental health is to talk about it. So I am doing so. Please feel free to reach out and ask me anything. I don’t think I have all the answers. But given a question, I know where to start looking.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="a39a" name="a39a"><img alt="human silhouette with blue halo effect" class="graf-image" data-height="2532" data-image-id="0*TiMnd1tPji3YVLHN" data-unsplash-photo-id="2LowviVHZ-E" data-width="4500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TiMnd1tPji3YVLHN"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@benjaminsweet?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@benjaminsweet?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Ben Sweet</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
