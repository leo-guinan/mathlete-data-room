But I was never able to convince myself what to write. Mostly, I was focused on technical topics. I was in tech, so that made sense to write about, right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3356" name="3356">Maybe. But I wasn’t ever able to really make myself do it. So what changed?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a65" name="2a65">My view of what writing really is.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f12a" name="f12a">It isn’t just a way to document scientific facts, or create technical documentation, although obviously those are part of it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d4db" name="d4db">It is a way of opening up, of sharing, regardless of the topic. Maybe you are sharing knowledge, maybe you experiences, maybe your imagination. But you are sharing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4a04" name="4a04">And I didn’t know how to share anymore.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="21fc" name="21fc">But then one day, I realized the trick. The trick to everything. Everything is in sharing. Everything goes back to kindergarten principles. Except instead of toys, we need to be able to share ourselves openly with others. This does open us up to pain. That is the hard part. We don’t like the idea of pain. For the longest time, I had a very hard time in dealing with criticism at all. For me to be criticized, it meant I had obviously screwed everything up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8549" name="8549">So great, let’s start writing for the internet, right? Let’s open ourselves up to a literal world of criticism. But why?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="4d76" name="4d76">Because it is worth it. I finally figured out how to open myself up. I am letting myself be open and honest with people in my life for the first time in a long time. It is terrifying, and it is liberating. I decided to make the leap. And I know I can be better, and I want to be better. So now I am ready to take the criticism. Because I want to grow. And to grow, I need to be able to open up to the world, understanding the pain that may come along with it.</p></div></div></section>
