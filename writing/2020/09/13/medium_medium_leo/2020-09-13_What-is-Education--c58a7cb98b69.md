Unlike most of writing though, I want to venture into the past to begin.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="73eb" name="73eb">Let’s start 100 years ago.The specific date isn’t really important, but I really want to think of a time before the technology became widespread and we got overloaded with data.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2cab" name="2cab">So what was the purpose of Education back then? Knowledge transfer. The main sources of information were other people and books. People with specific knowledge in different areas either shared their knowledge directly with others, or through a book. So It became very important for reading to be the basis for Education. Reading is half of the equation, and therefore must be focused on in early childhood and built up over time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cfa4" name="cfa4">Then something happened. Something called the Internet. And everything changed. But also, nothing did. Let’s now examine Education in the time of the Internet. The prior goal of Education was knowledge transfer; is this still true?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5f4a" name="5f4a">The Internet has become an abundant source of information on any topic you can imagine. And many topics you cannot. This has created an interesting shift that I don’t think we have addressed well, or at all. The Internet has become the main platform for knowledge transfer. And that works incredibly well, as people can share what they know with the world. But it also has downsides. I don’t know that I need to spell them all out, but the reality is that by knowing you have the ability to spread information widely, you also need to understand what you are spreading. And some people understand very well exactly what they are spreading.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="84d1" name="84d1">Education will not be able to compete with the Internet on knowledge sharing. Nor should it. What we need to realize is that there is an incredible wealth of knowledge out there. There are also some incredibly dangerous ideas. We need to understand this, and modify our Education system accordingly. Instead of teaching everyone facts to memorize out of an outdated book, let’s start focusing on how to learn. How to understand the quality of information being examined. Education should be about finding a passion and understanding the world better. The facts are out there, and easily found online. But problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, research skills, and other related skills are lacking. We should also consider teaching programming not as an end, but as a means to an end. Programming can be used by everyone to make their lives easier in some small way, or even some big ones. And what if everyone had the ability to create a small script, just to minimize the tedium they may find in a given job? I think the world would look like a very different place.</p></div></div></section>
