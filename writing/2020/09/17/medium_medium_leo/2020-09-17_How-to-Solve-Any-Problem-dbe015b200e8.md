And I haven’t had much success in doing so. Until I realized the above. I had been trying to solve the wrong problems. Here are two examples of problems I am currently solving in my life:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ddc2" name="ddc2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hard Problem: Weight Loss</strong></p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="71bf" name="71bf"><img alt="Woman with squat bar" class="graf-image" data-height="5271" data-image-id="0*yDUHZMaLmM0q1j09" data-unsplash-photo-id="5UbIqV58CW8" data-width="3514" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yDUHZMaLmM0q1j09"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@hipcravo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@hipcravo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Hipcravo</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="7e2d" name="7e2d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Background</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6ad7" name="6ad7">I have struggled with my weight most of my life. I have tried dieting and exercise. But things would work, and then they wouldn’t. My weight would go up and down, with my moods oscillating accordingly.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2bda" name="2bda"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Current State: Down 40 lbs in last 6 months</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fd85" name="fd85">Instead of trying to solve the big hard weight loss problem, I decided to solve some small, easy problems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5a67" name="5a67"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Small Problem 1: Move More</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9067" name="9067">Instead of focusing on my weight, I decided to just try to move a little bit more. I tried to track my steps, and just try to walk a little more each day. I didn’t track my steps religiously though; I only occasionally looked at them for a given day, but overall I was looking for a slight upward trend.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ee67" name="ee67"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Small Problem 2: Drink more water</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c9c2" name="c9c2">One of my main problems has been a love of pop and energy drinks. I was fully aware of this, but that didn’t make it easy for me to break. So I decided to try to substitute a bottle of water any time I went for a pop. I was occasionally successful starting out. I just tried to note when I was successful, praise myself for it, and move on. If I wasn’t successful, I did try to make a note of that as well. Not to punish myself, just to see if there was anything I could do to become more successful next time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9013" name="9013"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Small Problem 3: Eating when not Hungry</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7286" name="7286">This problem was not one that I initially set out to solve. But it ended up getting solved. One thing I found was that by being mindful of how much I was moving, and how much water I was drinking, I became much more mindful of everything else I was doing. Therefore, when I started to reach for food, it became natural to ask myself : “Why?” And then I started to stop.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="06a1" name="06a1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Observations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="eab1" name="eab1">In looking back on this, I never made any difficult changes. I tried to observe what I was doing occasionally, and just make small tweaks. By doing so, I was able to achieve a much larger goal. I still have a long way to go, but I don’t worry about it anymore. I eat what I want. I drink what I want. I just don’t let what I want now become what I want always.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="31ce"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="f082" name="f082"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hard Problem 2: Integration Testing Suite</strong></p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="9e8a" name="9e8a"><img alt="over the shoulder view of computer screen" class="graf-image" data-height="5304" data-image-id="0*6tMmAq-JW50EF-6t" data-unsplash-photo-id="hoivM01c-vg" data-width="7952" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6tMmAq-JW50EF-6t"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="9a75" name="9a75">This is a bit more technical in nature. Don’t worry if you don’t fully understand some of the concepts I mention. I just wanted to highlight the two very different realms that I have applied this advice to.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ae55" name="ae55"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Background</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a60c" name="a60c">I have been working on a software development project for a few years now. I have been with it since the beginning, and was responsible for most of its architecture. But there has always been an issue. I have never managed to quite get the testing to be as comprehensive as I wanted. I have hammered away at the problem for literal years now (with my team).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="606f" name="606f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Small Problem 1: Minor Change Request</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d55d" name="d55d">I was working on a story for a minor change to one of our processes. It could be fixed with one or two lines of code. But instead of doing what I would normally do, and just make the small change, I thought about the product I was working on. And I started writing code from the middle. I completely ignored what currently existed. I ignored my normal adherence to Test Driven Development (TDD). And I just let my mind flow with the code. I knew I could always fall back and make the super quick change if I needed to. But I decided to have some fun with it. I am currently two days into this process. And now I have an integration testing framework built. I decided to simply try to solve a small problem a little differently. And it opened up my eyes to a whole new realm of possibilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e288" name="e288"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Observations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="4488" name="4488">I have to say, I did not expect to solve that problem. My team had been working on it since the beginning. But there was an extra piece of information that I noticed, and would like to call out specifically: the testing didn’t work well because we had tied our vision of what could be to what was. Those are two very different things. Or at least they should be.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="3ac3"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="c25f" name="c25f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84bd" name="84bd">I hope these two case studies of problems I am solving in my own life can help you as well. There are two points I really hope you take away from this:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="c8fa" name="c8fa">If a problem is hard, try to solve an easy problem related in some way to the hard problem</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing" id="5d56" name="5d56">Do not let the past force your future. Learn from it, but be willing to change things.</li></ul></div></div></section>
