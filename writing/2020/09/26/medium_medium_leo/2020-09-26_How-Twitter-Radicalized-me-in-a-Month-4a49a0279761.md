I saw so many things happening around me, and I couldn’t do much about it. So I decided to write, and try to help out a few people at least.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="25a2" name="25a2">Before taking on this goal of writing though, I have been a software engineer. I work to optimize processes. As part of my writing, I was trying to build an audience. I was using social media to engage with people. And I was using it mindfully like I have started doing everything else in my life. I was trying to fully engage people that I met. I made some great connections. But then, my attitude shifted. I began to see all of the injustices. It messed with my head. I lost sight of everything outside of the injustices of the world. I wrote a piece that went viral. It was intended to. It was essentially propaganda at that point. I wanted to change the world, and change it now. And that is what radicalization is, I realized. The only way to create lasting progress is to do it together. Every side has valid concerns. Every side has valid ideas. But the only way to determine our truth is to agree on what it is. For this, we need to share our ideas. The best ideas will rise to the top. With social media, the loudest ideas rise to the top. I wanted to get clicks, so I figured out how to get loud. And I did. It was an obvious departure from everything else I had written. Until this one piece, I hadn’t received a single negative comment. Because I was of the idea that we need to do away with conflict in order to reach society’s full potential. But I optimized for results. The same way other engineers optimize their code. And that completely shifted the message I was trying to deliver. It happened to me very quickly. But this is because I was constantly shifting the way I was writing. I was attempting to find my voice. Social media gave me the power to experiment. I was able to experiment with my ideas. Put them out into the world, and see what happened. But unfortunately, social media was optimizing me for clicks, the same way I was trying to optimize my articles for clicks. When I realized this, I pulled the plug on my social media. I started writing as a way to balance my life out. Social media, while offering a ton of positives, gave me a shortcut. It showed me that there was a faster way to get readers. I am human; I took the shortcut offered. And it flung my life out of balance again.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6aa2" name="6aa2">I do want to be clear. Social media in and of itself is not evil. Like so many things, when used specifically, mindfully, and responsibly, it can be something with almost endless benefits. It can also very easily start manipulating your life in ways that are hard to detect. I was quite literally studying these very effects. I was trying to understand how certain ideas are spread online. Now, I know. That is quite evident to me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="5cfc" name="5cfc">I am trying to only add things to my life that increase happiness. Social media did, until it very much did not. Thus, I got rid of it. It isn’t that easy. I still reach to my phone, thinking I am going to check Twitter. But then I don’t. Because it is gone. And the urge passes. I can change the world. But not all at once. And if I really want to change the world, I start by perfecting myself. So I am going to go back to that. That is the goal I had when I started writing, and I lost sight of it. But now I am back on track. The good news is that a lesson publically leaned is a very powerful teaching tool. And that is why I am sharing the experience. I learned a lesson, and it sucked. The best lessons usually do. But you screw up, you reflect, you fix, and you move on. So, onward.</p></div></div></section>
