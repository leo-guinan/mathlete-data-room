But, while I can answer it, you cannot (probably, which is why I assume you are here). So we need to find something we can all agree on, and build up from there. If you read to the end, and understand each part, you will be able to travel through time in order to solve any problem. So let’s maybe ask a different question.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="514b" name="514b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Time Travel?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="60a9" name="60a9">This should be a pretty easy question to answer, right? Time travel is simply traveling in time. But you can’t really define a phrase with a word containing it. So we need to step down one more level.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3e46" name="3e46"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Time?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1819" name="1819">Ok, this question we can answer. Time is broken up into three parts. Past, Present, and Future. I don’t care about the details of each of these parts, we can all start with these three parts, and be satisfied with the definition of time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="748d" name="748d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Time Travel?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5ba" name="e5ba">Time travel is the ability to travel from the Present to either the Past or the Future</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="140f" name="140f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Quantum Mechanics?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c5b1" name="c5b1">Quantum Mechanics are the rules governing Time Travel.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c54" name="4c54">Ok. So now we have a definition that we can all work with. So now that you understand what Quantum Mechanics is, you can learn how to travel through time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e197" name="e197"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Present</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7447" name="7447">What is the Present? In order to understand the rules governing the Present, we need to understand the Present. The Present is what we can verify as reality right now. Your current state in the world is your Present. This includes all of your thoughts, ideas, emotions, location, everything that is you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e235" name="e235"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rules Governing The Present</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="d9eb" name="d9eb">The only one who fully knows your Present is You.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="647e" name="647e">The Present is immutable. It cannot be changed.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="78c4" name="78c4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Past</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="08fd" name="08fd">What is the Past? The Past is a vortex, swirling out from the Present. The Past is a puzzle with an infinite number of pieces.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="21e2" name="21e2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rules Governing the Past</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="a747" name="a747">The further away from the Present you get, the less clarity you have.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="5ed5" name="5ed5">You can pick out certain pieces of the past, but never the whole puzzle.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="0f3f" name="0f3f">You can always find new pieces to the puzzle.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="12ca" name="12ca">Every puzzle piece is itself a puzzle that can be broken into multiple pieces.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="a9dd" name="a9dd">Every puzzle is itself a puzzle piece, as the opposite rule to the one above.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="87f0" name="87f0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Future</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="afcc" name="afcc">The Future is the same as the Past, in an opposite direction.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="31f4" name="31f4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rules Governing the Future</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6718" name="6718">The rules are the same as the rules for the Past.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="21a7" name="21a7">This part is the key to Time Travel.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="6ae1" name="6ae1">You can always find new pieces to the puzzle.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="ea96" name="ea96">You can look into the Past to find pieces to help you understand. This is by doing research. Understanding as much as you can about the Past. Knowing that what you have is never a complete view of the Past. You can also look into the Future. Use your mind to realize the possibilities you can see for yourself. When you combine these possibilities (puzzle pieces) with the lessons learned from the Past (puzzle pieces), you start creating more possibilities (puzzle pieces). Think about that.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="17f7" name="17f7">When you combine these possibilities (puzzle pieces) with the lessons learned from the Past (puzzle pieces), you start creating more possibilities (puzzle pieces).</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing" id="e317" name="e317">There. You have yourself a perpetual motion device, if you realize it. Your actions cause ripple effects, which lead to more actions. You get puzzle pieces that lead you to different puzzles. Each moment in time and space is its own puzzle. You may never see the whole pictures in the Past and Future, but you can always use the pieces to build whatever puzzle you want in the Present. If you don’t have the pieces to make the puzzle you want, start looking to the Past and Future. Every so often, check to see what pieces you have, and what picture you want to make. The picture you may want to make at a given time will change. But the number of pieces always increases, if you let it. For me, the way to keep track of my puzzle pieces was by writing. I am trying to use my writing to show you the pictures that I came up with. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I am always happy to share the pieces I have found in life, and I am learning how to share the pictures as well. Our Future will be imagined by all the pieces we can find. Keep looking for pieces. Keep sharing your pieces. And then the Future is the sum of all of our pieces. And the possibilities are endless.</p></div></div></section>
