Then a simple thought occurred to me. Privilege can be easily understood as having the ability to make mistakes and learn from them. That is what I have. I have the ability to make a mistake, without it ending my life or making it much, much worse. I can then learn from it and grow. But if you aren’t given that freedom to make a mistake, growth is much harder. You have to play it safe. You always have to be watching for what lurks ahead in the shadows. Each move has to be carefully calculated. But others in life, myself very much included, have the ability to make mistakes. For example, anyone following my writing saw me make a huge mistake, in order to try to get views. It worked, kind of. It got views, but in a manner inconsistent with who I am and who I want to be. I have the privilege of being able to escape from this mistake with just a lesson learned. I think many others would have a much harder time making a mistake of this magnitude and coming out pretty much unscathed. Sure, I feel I handled it in the best possible way, by owning it and learning from it, but I had the freedom to make that mistake. I am thankful for that freedom, because that is the easiest way for me to grow. I want to help give others the freedom to make mistakes as well. We should all have the opportunity to make mistakes. That is the easiest way to grow.</p></div></div></section>
