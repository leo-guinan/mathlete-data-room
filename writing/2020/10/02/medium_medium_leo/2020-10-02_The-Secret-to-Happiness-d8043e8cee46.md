Trying to think about what makes a person happy. I have recently discovered my own happiness. I have been trying to figure out a way to share the secret with people. The secret is to live in a bubble. Or rather, we all live in our own bubbles. The secret is to learn to control the bubble. When we can all control our own bubbles, amazing things start to happen. We are all able to find happiness in our own lives, which then expands to creating happiness in others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="04db" name="04db">Those are all some great words to throw around.

That is where Conflict occurs. Conflict is a state in which your Bubble has one or more bubbles broken.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6994" name="6994"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How to Control Your Bubble</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5cc" name="e5cc">Now that you know you are in a Bubble, let’s talk about how to control your Bubble. In order to control your Bubble, you need to control each of your bubbles. In other words, you need to set each of your boundaries in your life very specifically. This is the part that can be hard, but it is only hard if you fight it. The more you accept it, the easier it becomes. You need to understand where each of your bubbles currently exists. This involves pushing around your boundaries. Removing some. Moving others. Trying to experience new things in life. If you have no idea where to start, look at your fears. Your fears are where some of the most obvious boundaries lie. Look inside your self. What do you fear most? Is it failure? It was for me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="587f" name="587f">That is why I didn’t start writing, until recently. I was worried about failing. But I moved that boundary around. What is failure? If it is a habit, insanity according to Einstein. If it is something new, it is a learning opportunity. So I stopped worrying about failure. I started writing. I failed big. But I am continuing. I am constantly learning. Constantly adjusting my bubbles. When you figure out one bubble you can control, you start to see where all of the other bubbles live. Then you can adjust them when you realize they are not in the correct spots to make you Happy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a49f" name="a49f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rules of the Bubble</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4d97" name="4d97">In the case of Conflict, it occurs whenever someone says it does. Every person is the only one who knows their own Bubble. If they realize a bubble has been broken, it has. The other side of this rule though, is that there must be a system of communication in place to acknowledge and resolve conflict. A bubble cannot be repaired if the breaking entity is not aware of the bubble. When communication is easy, bubbles can be quickly and efficiently put back into place. The less communication, the harder it is to repair broken bubbles.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="965a" name="965a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Trauma</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2067" name="2067">Trauma is the result of many bubbles being broken in a short amount of time. I do not recommend exploring your bubbles alone if you have previously experienced trauma. The mind has interesting constructs for dealing with trauma, and I am not an expert in them. I believe that counseling can really help explore some of the bubbles in a safe environment.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a0dd" name="a0dd"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Coexistence</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="80fd" name="80fd">It is possible for two or more Bubbles to occupy the same space and time. The best way this can occur though is for all Bubbles to exist in a state of Happiness. All Bubble owners aware of their bubbles, and letting each other into various bubbles. This works perfectly if and only if bubbles are understood to be Happy at this point in time, and a sharing of bubbles now or in the past does not guarantee any sharing of bubbles in the future.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="58ce" name="58ce"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Outcomes</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="07a4" name="07a4">Since I have been exploring my own bubbles lately, I have realized something. I have let a lot of bubbles remain at their default setting. Personally, I like to customize everything to myself. Why not my bubbles too? I had a bubble in place that was preventing me from writing, because I wasn’t a writer. So I removed that bubble. And I found another one. And another one. When you examine the bubbles you have in place, you see those that you have put up for no reason other than you thought you should. That was just the default setting, and you accepted it, not aware of it. And there is nothing wrong with that. But know you can also customize it to fit your preferences. So examine your bubbles. Find a single bubble, and examine that. Why is it there? Is it set to the place you want it? If not, adjust the bubble until you like it. Once you realize the level of control you have over your Bubble, you will only live in Happiness. Because any other state of Conflict is understood and resolved.</p></div></div></section>
