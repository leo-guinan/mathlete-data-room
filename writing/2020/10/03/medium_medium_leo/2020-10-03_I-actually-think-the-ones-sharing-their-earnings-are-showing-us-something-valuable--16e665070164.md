Look at the trends. They write a bunch. They have outreach. They understand that content is the future. They are trying to explain to people how to monetize their content asap, because it is the path to freedom. They realized that ideas are valuable now, not money. And ideas appreciate over time. So share ideas now and let them start earning for you. It is compound interest on the value you provide people through your writing. But use money to judge how well you reach an audience, not as the goal in writing. Separate money from value.</p></div></div></section>
