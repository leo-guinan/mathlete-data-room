If we look at governments and economies, things were coming into balance. Everything seemed like it was going well. Look at the hippies. They saw what was happening.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bdab" name="bdab">Then the world broke. I believe I figured out why, how it happened, and how we can move forward.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="0925" name="0925"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Why</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1640" name="1640">The answer is to follow the money. It always comes down to money. Money was a great system. It was a way to tie physical items that took different resources to a single concept of value. The physical items were limited resources that were combined into a single item, given a price, and depreciated over time. Inflation existed because of this and kept depreciation in balance. It was all coming to an equilibrium. Then we invented computers. This broke our timeline.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8d83" name="8d83"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">How It Happened</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0979" name="0979">The short answer is that it was the butterfly effect. A single thing turned the tide of the economy because the economy was not ready to adapt. Value was no longer based in physical items. Value was created by data. The flow of data changed the world. Instead of value being in physical items that were being created, an<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scarcity.asp" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scarcity.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> economy of scarcity</a>, value was now in information. Information actually appreciates in value. This is the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://geo.coop/blog/seven-key-elements-economy-abundance" href="https://geo.coop/blog/seven-key-elements-economy-abundance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">economy of abundance </a>that we also hear about.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7af9" name="7af9">This inflection point caused several interesting effects. Primarily, money was no longer balanced between value, time, and resources. With time and resources limited, money was limited, and it worked fine. Then resources went from scarce to abundant. This completely threw money off balance. This is evident from the chart below.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="14fc" name="14fc"><img alt="graph indicating change in economy at rise of computers" class="graf-image" data-height="525" data-image-id="1*xIRXheNrDlfWJGQkGnBUaw.png" data-width="710" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xIRXheNrDlfWJGQkGnBUaw.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/" href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="1938" name="1938">The problem is that money still tied value to time. This caused us to tie employees to time. Companies started creating value at astronomical rates. But that value was not transferred appropriately to employees. This caused the time of employees to be completely devalued. I have seen this balance shifting back toward the employee in my own life and career. It still isn’t there yet though. Employer income started increasing exponentially and employee income progressed linearly. This caused a ripple effect that has led us to today’s society. We are now in a fractured world.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="35e3" name="35e3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">How To Move Forward</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="fb17" name="fb17">I think we need to break the timeline we are stuck in. To do this, we need to fix the market. It isn’t hard; money is infinite now. We need to immediately forgive all debt. Debt is causing us to be anchored to a broken past. We need to institute <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UBI</a>. We need to have government paid healthcare. This is why we are shifting toward these ideas. They are the best way forward given the economy is now abundant. We need to let everyone break from the past, not just those with money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2052" name="2052">The other problem to fix is technology. We optimized technology for profit and this is hurting us now. It prioritized money instead of consumer value. This has led to some severely damaged brains. I speak as someone who recently escaped from the prison I created for myself. It has completely skewed our perception of the world and now we live in a constant state of fear. We need to recenter our technology around the individual. Let’s figure out how to enhance the person’s experience of the world the most.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6dc3" name="6dc3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">How To Fix Technology</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="ad0e" name="ad0e">I am currently designing something I am calling the Human API. In programming terms, an Application Programmer Interface (API) is a way to encapsulate a system. This allows it to change internally and also allows for change external to the system. It creates a clear path for information to flow. For me, it is a way to set appropriate boundaries between myself and technology. I recommend that everyone start examining their own.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="89f9" name="89f9">I have seen both sides of the internet. I have seen the absolute value and some of the worst places, full of hate. I traced it all back to money. If we fix the money, we can fix the world. I will continue to work on my API and hopefully, the world will find value in it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="95e2" name="95e2">Find your balance in life. Make technology an easier path to balance instead of an easier path to money. Money doesn’t really matter anymore. Stop tying us all to the past.</p></div></div></section>
