It isn’t what you think it is. I recently realized that I had it. Then I understood exactly what it is.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3529" name="3529">There are two kinds of problems in this world. Problems that have been solved before and problems that have not. We have started to condition kids to solve only the kind of problem that has been solved before. The problem is that there are kids who tend towards those problems and they excel. The kids who enjoy the other kind of problem are taught the same way though. It has to do with a broad view of the universe around you vs. a narrow view of something specific in the universe.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="75d9" name="75d9">Nobody has trouble focusing on something they are interested in. The problem with ADHD is that we are penalizing kids for getting bored after they figure out the concept being taught. Sure, they will make mistakes because they blast through their work, but they obviously understand the main point. We have connected learning to money though and that has messed up education a bit due to the creation of computers and is the topic of some of my other writing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0e44" name="0e44">The truth is, there is one kind of problem that can be automated and that is one we have solved before. So we are pushing kids to be like machines while we are building machines to be machines. This creates a bit of imbalance, see?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1312" name="1312">Creativity is the future. Exploring things to levels not before discovered. Sharing them with the world. Teach your kids to create. Teach them to explore. Technology has a hold on them right now but I am working to fix that problem elsewhere. Technology should give kids the ability to grab any knowledge they want whenever they need it. Right now, it is programming them due to a bit of a miscalculation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7a8f" name="7a8f">I am working to shift the power of technology to the person instead of the computers. We can exist together as long as we establish clear boundaries. I am trying to design those boundaries right now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ae36" name="ae36">Direct your kids outside some. It is not terrible when they explore electronics. Talk to them about it though. Make sure they can put them down. If they can’t, that is a programming bug. The best way to fix that is to reboot them. Break them free from the hold of electronics for a bit. Show them that the world around them is beautiful and teach them to enjoy it with the help of technology instead of its control.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="b15f" name="b15f">The future is bright if you design it that way. Let’s design it that way together.</p></div></div></section>
