I had the realization that money is infinite now and I am living a severely limited lifestyle compared to what I would like. I make a solid six figures a year but I live in a crappy rental house and have for a decade. I keep waiting for my break while I climb the corporate ladder.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="20ad" name="20ad">I have been working hard for almost a decade and teaching myself to build computer software. I always figured that would be my end state. Eventually, I would build something that was cool enough to break me free from my life that I was feeling stuck in.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="addb" name="addb">I have written other pieces on how we can fix the economy. I think we can pretty easily if we get everyone to settle down and realize some things together. However, I am super impatient. So I decided to fix my own economy to prove my ideas.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="9e24" name="9e24"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/07/09/helpful-behavioral-economics-concepts-for-the-business-minded/" href="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/07/09/helpful-behavioral-economics-concepts-for-the-business-minded/" title="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/07/09/helpful-behavioral-economics-concepts-for-the-business-minded/"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Helpful Behavioral Economics Concepts for the Business-Minded | Data Driven Investor</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">In corporate America, Gaussian statistics, deterministic interpretations of the world around us, and rational…</em>www.datadriveninvestor.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="cc879204ff4da3bc3ec6a82dc04f0400" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*A1BanfNHn2heo1wd" href="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/07/09/helpful-behavioral-economics-concepts-for-the-business-minded/" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*A1BanfNHn2heo1wd);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="daf7" name="daf7">I see the future as content. There are two kinds of problems in the world: those that have been solved before and those that haven’t. The first is an optimization problem. Figuring out how to do something that we know how to do, but better or faster. These problems usually bore me but this is also what computer programming is. Or at least, should be.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5e3d" name="5e3d">I realized that I love the second type of problem. I love figuring out the answers to problems we haven’t answered yet. I love trying to look at a problem from all sides and understanding it. Once I do, the problem gets solved.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="262d" name="262d">One of the problems that I see in today’s world is that we are all trying to make people conform to ideas in order to protect their money. If money isn’t quite what we thought it is though, why should we conform? We are telling people to conform, limiting them to lives that are based on their money. Money is stupid. I am going to make a ton of it to prove it. The future is the individual.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a3c5" name="a3c5">I think I have a plan to focus the future on the individual. I think we are heading there and I want to hurry it along (again, I am not a patient person). So I have decided to churn out content at astronomical rates. I am writing on average a post day I believe, with many days having more than one. I have a bunch of drafts in progress and I am refining my skill.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e66b" name="e66b">I had been focusing way too hard on programming and not on living. Programming is automating the past. Writing is automating the future. I am ready to build my own future. When I do, I am going to bring everyone there with me, because I didn’t get here alone.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ca9c" name="ca9c">Gain Access to Expert View — <a class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" data-href="https://datadriveninvestor.com/ddi-intel" href="https://datadriveninvestor.com/ddi-intel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Subscribe to DDI Intel</a></h4></div></div></section>
