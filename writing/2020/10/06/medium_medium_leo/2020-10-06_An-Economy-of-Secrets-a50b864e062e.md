I have been trying to keep an eye out for my break. I have always wanted to be the next big thing. The next unicorn. I just needed the right information.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f6cb" name="f6cb">Then I took some time to examine my own mental health. This gave me the information that I so desperately sought. I had been programmed over a decade in industry to pursue money. In doing so, I became a pretty good programmer. I doubled my salary in less than 10 years. I just kept chasing a dream that I couldn’t catch. That’s when I realized I had been chasing the wrong thing. I suspect many of you are too.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e06f" name="e06f">The economy and my mental health have one thing in common. Secrets.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0473" name="0473">I have written previously about the economy and why I feel there is a problem. It has to do with the shift from value being in physical goods to the value being in data. Data is the key to the future. He who controls the data, controls the money.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="1cc3" name="1cc3"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">It’s Time To Give The Invisible Hand Of The Market a High Five</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The Economy Is Broken.

It has created an economy of secrets. Trade secrets, company secrets, all kinds of secrets. We see people sharing their “secrets” they have discovered all the time online.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="350f" name="350f">I think this idea of secrets has messed up some of our minds. Personally, during my own journey to find and keep mental health, I realized something. I didn’t have anyone in my life that I was completely honest with. Not my wife, not my family, not even myself.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2879" name="2879">I did this because of the power of secrets. Bad things can easily exist in the shadows. My mental health was a good example of that. I put on a smile. I acted like I was happy. I turned myself into a robot. Nobody wanted or needed to see my innermost thoughts. So I just kept them to myself.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3d28" name="3d28">I saw the same thing online. I saw people get hurt, repeatedly, online. I talked to those who were hurt. I tried to understand them. I talked to some who were doing the hurting. I tried to understand them as well.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a12a" name="a12a">I never tried to understand myself.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5363" name="5363">I was a secret. Nobody needed to know who I was. Not even me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a036" name="a036">There is power in information. If I keep secrets, I can therefore keep power. Right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0880" name="0880">I am of the opinion that we are all too focused on secrets. I have been trying to figure my own out through a combination of reflection and writing. It occurred to me that secrets are actually against human nature. We are built to communicate. Secrets hamper, not aid, communication. I think this is giving all of us some extreme cognitive dissonance.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d676" name="d676">Personally, I am starting to try to do things a little differently. I am posting more writing than I would have ever dreamed of doing. This is my way to open up to the world, but on my own terms. I started trying on Twitter, but that didn’t end well for me.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="75e0" name="75e0"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/into-the-belly-of-the-beast-5ccab6cc4c00" href="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/into-the-belly-of-the-beast-5ccab6cc4c00" title="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/into-the-belly-of-the-beast-5ccab6cc4c00"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Into The Belly of the Beast</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">A Case Study on how Information can be used to Manipulate Emotions</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="b710d940da081db2f6c023e7c48ed86c" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*qTlQ2I4N9glW_7st" href="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/into-the-belly-of-the-beast-5ccab6cc4c00" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*qTlQ2I4N9glW_7st);"></a></div><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="d4a3" name="d4a3"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-to-fail-at-everything-4ad8ccdb95bc" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-to-fail-at-everything-4ad8ccdb95bc" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-to-fail-at-everything-4ad8ccdb95bc"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">How To Fail At Everything</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">And Come Out a Better Person For It</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="a2241562db4717b0f75bab1326a0dbc4" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*IuOJb37552tQKkvG" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-to-fail-at-everything-4ad8ccdb95bc" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*IuOJb37552tQKkvG);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing" id="e3f1" name="e3f1">I have a lot of things to figure out.
