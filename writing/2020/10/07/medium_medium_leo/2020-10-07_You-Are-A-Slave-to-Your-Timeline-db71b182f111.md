I used a very emotionally charged word in the title. I did this very intentionally. I believe that we are currently enslaved by our past. It limits our present and our future by removing our choices in life. We may get to make small, insignificant changes, but overall, we do what we have to do to get by. We make the decisions that we have to in the moment. We deal with the consequences after the fact. I believe that most of you are still enslaved by time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="edb4" name="edb4">But you don’t have to be.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="4732" name="4732"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">How We Got This Way</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9cfe" name="9cfe">It all made sense, back before computers. Look at how humanity was evolving. There was a progression throughout time. There were ups and downs, but progress overall. Then we hit 1960ish. That is when computers started to get developed at speed. This shifted the meaning of money and broke the economy.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f599" name="f599"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">What is Money, Really?</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9028" name="9028">Money is a model we use to represent value. This works perfectly well in the real world when physical items were worth money. It allowed two people with different needs to have a common system. This was a good system. It optimized itself.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e555" name="e555"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">What Changed?</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f299" name="f299">Value. Value was no longer based in physical items. Value is now created by having data about physical items. Let’s see what difference that makes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4b80" name="4b80">A physical item is worth the most at the time of its creation. By definition, everything physical depreciates over time. It loses value over time. Money inflates to cover that. This was bringing us into balance.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8788" name="8788">Then the world changed. Data became the driver for value. But data doesn’t depreciate in value. Data appreciates in value. Data was easily obtainable by those with money and the knowledge of its importance. That led to the wage gap we now see.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d3b9" name="d3b9">We went from a driver of value that went down over time, requiring money to constantly be added to make progress to one that went up. The people with the data made astronomical profits. This is because money is limitless now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="63fe" name="63fe">If money is limitless, why do people not have what they need to live? Why are people struggling because they don’t have it? Because of time. We tied money into time as well as value. And that also helps break the economy.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="20a9" name="20a9"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Time</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0181" name="0181">We attached money to time as well as value. Everyone in a corporation understands trying to balance these three things. But what if we only focus on the value created? Time and money no longer mean what they used to. So why are we letting them limit us the way they do?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d466" name="d466">Humans have been figuring out better ways to live and thrive throughout time. Communication is the key to this. The internet lets us communicate with anyone we need to. We learn from the past in order to predict and create the future. This all occurs through communication.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bc20" name="bc20">Think about everything we do in life. It is all set up to give us the ability to live and thrive in a society with limited resources. We just saw that resources are not limited anymore. Most of the rules no longer make sense.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1e75" name="1e75">Punishments should not be time-based or money-based. They should be outcome-based. We don’t help people by locking them up. We help them by figuring out what problem they are trying to solve and then helping them fix that problem.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="833e" name="833e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Money</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0951" name="0951">Money is honestly pretty stupid right now. It complicates the whole system and isn’t necessary. We need to strive for value, not money. I have encountered a bunch of people lately who have managed to break out of their timelines. They have done so by creating content. What is content really?</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="80f2" name="80f2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The Future is Content</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9e3f" name="9e3f">Content is made up of curated ideas that we think are important. In other words, it shows us a connection between ideas that we may or may not have had. That is how we break free of time. We start acting as brokers for our own data. It isn’t simple now, but it is doable. Look for ways to monetize your social media. There is a reason that is a trend.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="002b" name="002b">The sooner you realize how to start, the sooner you can plan your escape. Create content now, even if it doesn’t make you money. It creates value for others, even if you don’t see it. It also helps you practice your craft for the new economy. It is coming if you watch the trends.</p></div></div></section>
