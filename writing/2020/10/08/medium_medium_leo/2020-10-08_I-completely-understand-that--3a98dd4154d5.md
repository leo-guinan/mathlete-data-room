I have been programming for about a decade now. I can’t tell you how many times I have personally turned a simple problem into an overly complex one. I think we have a natural tendency to do that as humans. I am just now understanding that mastery is demonstrated by being able to teach it to anyone, not just someone who has a very similar background.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="93ae" name="93ae">That is where I think academics end up with a bit of a blind spot. I have a unique perspective because I don’t have a group of people to discuss my ideas and theories with. If you start talking about quantum anything with the average person, they have some interesting reactions. Usually, their eyes glaze.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8659" name="8659">So I just decided to start writing, researching, and sharing. Not the standard academic process exactly, but I do take a lot of the ideas from academia. I am currently working on a second master’s degree and seriously considering going for a PhD when I finish. I never wanted one about August.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2ccf" name="2ccf">Now, I have a few potential avenues for research. These are some seriously exciting ideas. :)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e2cf" name="e2cf">Thanks for the response. It is greatly appreciated.</p></div></div></section>
