It was a big step for me and something I have been considering for quite a while. Mostly, I felt like a lot of the stuff that I would have to deal with just wouldn’t be worth the hassle.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b12e" name="b12e">So what changed?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cf57" name="cf57">I realized that the way we do things is stupid. Think about how much risk there typically is in any given startup venture. Why?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a420" name="a420">Money. The money is the risk.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea1a" name="ea1a">Typically, we have to build out a team, some sort of project, and then, if we are lucky, we might be able to secure some funding. This is great, for people that have the luxury of taking those risks.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7f40" name="7f40">The Reason I Didn’t Start Sooner</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0661" name="0661">I never have had that luxury. I always wanted to be part of a startup but I have two fairly young kids at home. My oldest son was born about 3 months after I graduated college. I never felt I had a choice. I needed money. So I have been grinding away at the corporate lifestyle, running on my hamster wheel, trying to beat the system that is rigged against everyone.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0075" name="0075">Then I came to a realization.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c758" name="c758">Startups shouldn’t be about risk. They should be about innovation. Innovation is how we can maximize human potential. I have written a bit on the subject of innovation and find it to be very much a function of diversity.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="5c0d" name="5c0d"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/innovation-through-legos-fc60ec5422de" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/innovation-through-legos-fc60ec5422de" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/innovation-through-legos-fc60ec5422de"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Innovation through Legos</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Building on a previous example.</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="8f06ef1e454df807fa93db9feabbbeba" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*yF3HFiNJQpi7Z0YV" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/innovation-through-legos-fc60ec5422de" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*yF3HFiNJQpi7Z0YV);"></a></div><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="9928" name="9928"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/diversity-is-the-key-to-innovation-1c47938a5ecb" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/diversity-is-the-key-to-innovation-1c47938a5ecb" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/diversity-is-the-key-to-innovation-1c47938a5ecb"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Diversity is the key to innovation</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Thinking with Legos</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="8921c00cefe45eefa595fb177fa5d865" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*pV57Iuw-UcX_bF13" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/diversity-is-the-key-to-innovation-1c47938a5ecb" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*pV57Iuw-UcX_bF13);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="654e" name="654e">Think about everyone excluded from trying to launch an idea. We are greatly limiting the diversity of the startup pool before we even start thinking about the ideas therein. This is very wrong to me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="adf9" name="adf9">I decided to do things differently. I am figuring out how to launch a startup with pretty much no money. I did spend $150 to get my LLC registered in the state of Wyoming. That gets me the LLC filed, a registered agent in Wyoming, and some basic mail services. That was my seed funding.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e945" name="e945">Step 1: Security Net</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7495" name="7495">In the meantime, I am keeping my corporate job. This is going to be my safety net. It will allow me everything I need to make sure I can provide for my family.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e3a4" name="e3a4">Step 2: Setting Financial Boundaries</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1558" name="1558">I am going to be opening up a super cheap business bank account. This will serve the purpose of being a way to track income/expenses separate from my personal accounts. Then I can tie my Medium earnings (all $50 of it so far) into that account as a way to prove a revenue stream.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a700" name="a700">Step 3: The Startup</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="cbed" name="cbed">Finally, I am going to be consulting though it. This is where the startup part comes in. I have a theory about humanity based on trends that I have seen throughout history and what I see today. I am not going to be charging for my consulting services. I am simply going to offer them to the world. If I create enough value for people, they will either pass some of that value back to me or they will pass it on to someone else. Think of it as an extreme case of pay-what-you-want.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd09" name="cd09">The cool part of this is the power it gives me to only work on the coolest problems. If I am not forcing myself to chase money, then I can chase some of the big problems that I want to work on solving.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c679" name="c679">Based on my economic theories, this should result in my maximum happiness.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e509" name="e509">Step 4: Backup Plan</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="16e8" name="16e8">I am, however, going to continue to write about any problems that I am able to work on or solve. I am also going to write about how well my payment structure works. I didn’t want to be a freelancer or consultant who was chasing down fees because they are just trying to survive.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="7e76" name="7e76">I am just not going to play that game. I am going to change the game.</blockquote><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote" id="c894" name="c894">Step 5: The Doubts</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b8be" name="b8be">When I wrote the first draft of this article, this step wasn’t here. I was flying high off of the excitement of taking a big step. The longer the day goes on, the more doubt I have creeping into my head. I know that this doubt is a part of human nature. I believe in my plans enough to know that value exists. I have proven it in several small cases. This is an extension of those ideas.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="a0a7" name="a0a7">And yet, the doubt remains.</blockquote><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote" id="6c66" name="6c66">What if Everything I Think is Wrong?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="30d4" name="30d4">Maybe I am wrong. That will at least lead to some evolution of my theories. I can always change my mind. It is really easy to change your mind when you tie money to outcomes. I love money as a measure of the validity of ideas. I just hate all of the other ideas tangled with money right now. I have written about how I think the economy is broken. This is one of my attempted fixes for it.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="e1a9" name="e1a9"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">It’s Time To Give The Invisible Hand Of The Market a High Five</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The Economy Is Broken. Here’s How To Fix It.</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="a0a0a06fe64a70a68eeef1015b0096cf" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*2FXhiEl7sK1g5pBh" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*2FXhiEl7sK1g5pBh);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing" id="8741" name="8741">The best part of all? I get to launch my startup without endangering my future nearly as much. I am hoping that I become successful enough in it to give everyone else the opportunity to launch their ideas. At least if I don’t, I should still end up with some pretty good stories to share and some alternative ideas to meet my goals.</p></div></div></section>
