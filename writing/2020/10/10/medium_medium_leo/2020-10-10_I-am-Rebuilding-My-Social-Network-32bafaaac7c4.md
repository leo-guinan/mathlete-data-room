There is a reason, I think. I grew up with the internet. And when I say that, I mean I was getting into computers before it even existed, and it really started to take off when I was in high school. I joined Facebook when it first opened to college students outside of Harvard.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="a150"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading" id="b37f" name="b37f">In the Beginning, there was Facebook</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="f707" name="f707">For a long time, my Facebook friend list matched my real friends. Or at least, friends of friends. My social network was manageable. Over time though, it grew. People from high school start adding you. Then family. And so on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4366" name="4366">I used to be rather outgoing. I didn’t care what people thought of me. I had facial piercings, tattoos, and I was studying computer science. I was ready to build the future.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3c16" name="3c16">College</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4a09" name="4a09">College was up and down for me. Took me about 7 years to finish my degree. I took some time off that may or may not have been mandated by the school. I had lost my focus on school and I needed to see where I didn’t want to be. I haven’t always had the easiest time in school. I was there to learn. When I learned I was happy. Why do I need to write a paper to tell you what I learned? We just talked about it. Writing papers is a waste of time, regurgitating stuff everybody already knows, but in a different order.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="86b1" name="86b1">When I was given a second chance, I jumped at it. I spent a lot of my off year drunk. I was working in a mall and going out to the bars with the same people almost every night of the week. I knew the bartenders at several local bars. This was the time in my life when I was the most social. My Facebook network continued to grow. I think it was around this time when I got Twitter, too.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="9b30" name="9b30">Then there was Twitter</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="ada8" name="ada8">Do you see the problem yet? I was in different phases of my life, living very different lives, and Facebook just threw them all together. In real life, our social networks grow and shrink with the natural flow of life. Online, right now, they just grow. They are not maintained well. This has an interesting outcome. It leaves paths for fake news.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3aaf" name="3aaf">What is fake news? It is information that you receive for which you have no context to connect it to the reality you see. In the real world, we have information flow to us when we request it typically. This works well, as a rule. It is called communication. This is how we learn and grow. Technology right now prefers the “push”. This isn’t too bad when you know how to set healthy boundaries.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b1c2" name="b1c2">You know who didn't? Me.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="12e7" name="12e7">Losing Myself</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a0dd" name="a0dd">I let myself get sucked into technology. I started to learn everything about it that I could. I learned a lot. I kept thinking that I could make myself into a computer. That was the secret to winning at life.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0078" name="0078">It wasn’t.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="345f" name="345f">I did turn myself into a computer, though. I kept learning and learning, hoping that one day, the secret would pop out at me. Then one day, it did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d0a0" name="d0a0">I wasn’t getting ahead because I was playing a game that had been rigged against me before I was born. Nobody’s fault. This is just what it was.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ffe7" name="ffe7">Do you know what the problem was? I didn’t really have any meaningful social relationships. I had a few through work and I had my wife and kids. I put everything forward to my wife was able to stay home and raise the kids. We wanted to give them the best lives we could.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="8c2f" name="8c2f">Now I want to change the game. I see how we can reset the game and make it fair for everyone. Let’s do that.</p></div></div></section>
