The more I look around the world, the more I realize how accurate it was. So many of us are in mini-timequakes of our own making. That is what habits are. Habits help us protect ourselves from the world around us. They let us stop worrying about the things that we don’t want to.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0f52" name="0f52">This works really well when we get to choose our own habits. We don’t have much of a choice anymore. We are given a bunch of choices that don’t matter to distract us from realizing we don’t get to make the choices that do. That is what advertising is right now. We get all sorts of choices to make. Just none that really matter.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="cf78" name="cf78">The Past</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1800" name="1800">It’s nobody’s fault. Humanity started to advance at a super rapid pace. We didn’t realize that by inventing the computer, we changed everything. I have the benefit of looking back over time and seeing how all of the pieces fit together. Humanity was on a path to peace until we invented the computer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a063" name="a063">There is a reason for that. Humans were communicating more than they ever had before. As communication went up, conflict went down. As communication went up, injustice went down. Until it didn’t.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="09ca" name="09ca">Human Evolution</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b269" name="b269">Humans have evolved to evolve. That is what communication gives us. Instead of each of us having to work on our own, we can tap on the whole of shared human understanding. Communication lets us talk to each other and realize that we are all human. We have different backgrounds, different understandings of the world, but we have a common bond. We have our humanity. Multiply this over the internet and we should have world peace. Super simple, right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d508" name="d508">It was, except there was a bug in the system. The bug was money. Humans optimize for learning through communication. Computers started optimizing for money. Computers won.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="5fb8" name="5fb8"><img class="graf-image" data-height="1231" data-image-id="1*uvYhmFl7zX12tMj3OTdPxw.png" data-width="808" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uvYhmFl7zX12tMj3OTdPxw.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Drawing by the author</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="425e" name="425e">I tried to draw the problem with the internet. In computer networking, the client-server model is very much the way all systems are designed. This mimics the teacher-student model in the lives of humans. This is how communication occurs naturally. Look at corporate structures or military chains of command. They all follow the same pattern.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a5ea" name="a5ea">This created some really interesting complications. It allowed ideas to connect in all sorts of different times. This made things very messy though. If you follow the wrong ideas down the wrong time, all you see is nonsense. All of it is fine in context, but it needs to be recognized as stuck in time and not necessarily true at this very second. You can’t really understand an event and not its context at the time it occurred.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="56b9" name="56b9">Internet</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="2a8f" name="2a8f">The internet started blending humans and computers without well-defined system boundaries. This created a lot of problems, not necessarily because they blended systems, but every time they blended a system and a person, they took a snapshot of the person at that time and saved it in the system.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1414" name="1414">Everybody on the internet is captured in billions of snapshots in time. This isn’t how real life works though. Time moves. People change and grow. When we realize this, it becomes a data engineering problem. We need to get a single source of truth for the data. The teacher to the student. The server to the client.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="724b" name="724b">Centering on the Person</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a16c" name="a16c">The only reliable source of the data about that person is the person themself. Therefore, we need to get the data in a single location and under the control of the person who owns it. This will have multiple outcomes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="465d" name="465d">It will let everyone control their own data and who has access to it at any point in time. It will also allow companies to be able to have access to a much larger, more complete, more current dataset. This allows them to create infinitely more value for their consumers. If they need data from consumers, they can pay the consumer directly for the data.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5b9a" name="5b9a">The Flow Of Information</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9643" name="9643">If you want information to flow better, give it a better path that is easier for it to flow. Like water flowing down a mountain, information flows easily down a hierarchy. Unlike water though, it also flows back up. This is why information is the answer to our economy. It is the only way we can see the whole picture.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e21e" name="e21e">The Future: Getting Out of the Timequake</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5191" name="5191">The only way to break a habit is to recognize it. Once you see the habit for what it is, you can stop the things that allow you to keep it. I am not going into too much detail on that. I will say that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Atomic Habits</em> is a book that did a good job helping me break some of mine. We have been programmed to create habits that are really bad for us due to a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" target="_blank">broken economy</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6d36" name="6d36">This programming has been happening since computers were invented. We programmed them to optimize for money. Then they programmed us to optimize for money. This has broken a lot of humans. Some humans were able to change and start chasing money. These humans typically had money to start with.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="214d" name="214d">Then there is the other side. They look at money and it doesn’t make sense to them. They don’t understand why people keep fighting when it is so obvious that cooperation is key to a peaceful society. They don’t understand why money is the only path to peace. This is a source of a lot of mental illness right now. Their view of the world online is much different than the one they see in front of them. It creates a painful cognitive dissonance and leads us to a culture of fear. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. We are all on the Dark side right now. Yoda told us so. We just haven’t listened yet.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="61db" name="61db"><img alt="picture of Yoda with the above quote" class="graf-image" data-height="561" data-image-id="1*NBOrOPEGeXhDoAozau9b7w.jpeg" data-width="1068" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NBOrOPEGeXhDoAozau9b7w.jpeg"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">source: <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://www.goalcast.com/2017/12/12/yoda-quotes-star-wars/" href="https://www.goalcast.com/2017/12/12/yoda-quotes-star-wars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.goalcast.com/2017/12/12/yoda-quotes-star-wars/</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="01a0" name="01a0">Talk to people. They are the same as you. They are people just trying to survive the best they can in a scary world right now. Communication is our greatest strength. Money is holding us back. We need to rebalance the Force.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="1c95" name="1c95">There you go. If you want to stop a timequake, just use the Force.</p></div></div></section>
