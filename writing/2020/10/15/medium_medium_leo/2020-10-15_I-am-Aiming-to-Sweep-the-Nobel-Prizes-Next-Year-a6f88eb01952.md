I started focusing less on the actual goals because they were so far away. I was able to forget about the end state and focus on where I was currently. I knew I was not in any way close to any of these goals. I was able to find something to start working toward, though.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="1940" name="1940">Goal: Be a billionaire by Christmas</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e600" name="e600">I do ok as a software engineer. Not as well as I think I should due to some poor financial decisions in my past, but ok. I am still working to overcome the past. This has been pretty limiting for me. It seems like no matter how hard I was working, I just wasn’t getting ahead. With my new goal, though, I was able to see that the answer wasn’t in my job (at least, entirely).</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="5ec6" name="5ec6">Now I have a mechanism for which I might be able to make $1,000,000,000.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="739f" name="739f">I started writing. I saw people on Medium making some money. I said to myself, “Self, you can write. That might be a way to make some money”. So I started.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ba98" name="ba98">I started my company. I have exactly $0 in sales at this point. I do, however, officially own my own business. Now I have a mechanism for which I might be able to make $1,000,000,000. I also have a few ideas that I can pursue.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d274" name="d274">I am continuing to work. I actually like my job for the most part. It does pay the bills, even if there isn’t always a ton left after the fact. The best part though is that it provides myself and my family a safety net that allows me to chase some of my bigger ambitions.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7b28" name="7b28">Goal: Join a Futsal Team</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="2709" name="2709">I have a long way to go. I have struggled with my weight my entire life. At the beginning of this year, I would get tired climbing a single flight of stairs. I lived a mostly sedentary life. I ate shitty food. I binged caffeine like it was my job. Not the life of a futsal player, eh?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1bee" name="1bee">Then I started to make some changes. Instead of a sugary energy drink, I went for water. I just tried to substitute a bottle of water for any other beverage when I thought of it. I made water the most convenient thing for me to grab.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="45f7" name="45f7">I also started walking the dog on longer and longer walks. Whereas I would previously take her outside for maybe a 5 minute walk, I started increasing it. Now, I usually take 3 20–30 minute walks a day. I just started by trying to walk a little bit further each day.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="597f" name="597f">I am making progress.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="52c9" name="52c9">Now, I am down almost 50 lbs. I still have a long path to playing futsal. I found that out when I started running around playing soccer with my youngest son a couple days ago. I was able to run, so that was a bit plus. I was able to play with him on the soccer field for quite a bit. That really meant a lot to me. I am still regretting it physically though. My body is taking quite a bit longer to recover. But I did it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c364" name="c364">I am making progress.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7d12" name="7d12">Goal: Buy a mansion</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5153" name="5153">I have been talking about wanting to buy a house for almost a decade now. As previously mentioned though, I used to suck with money, and that has stopped me from moving forward like I would like. Now, though, I am planning on being a billionaire by Christmas. Then I don’t need to worry about financing, right?</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="e428" name="e428">I also made a connection with someone who is now on my side.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="661a" name="661a">I started talking to a realtor in an area that I have been looking at houses in. I gave her a budget range that is 3–5x bigger than anything I had previously considered. I told her I was looking to have my business take off in the next 3–6 months, and while I couldn’t afford it now, I was confident that I would be able to at some point.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3cbb" name="3cbb">I was also honest about my previous money issues. I figured she would know someone who might be able to help me iron out the finances. She said that she would talk to some people she knew and see if she could figure out a way to help me. She also put me on a watch list for houses in that area in the given price range.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5702" name="5702">I forced myself to take action. It let me make progress to a goal even though I am not where I need to be yet. I also made a connection with someone who is now on my side. They want to help me meet my goals as that will also help them meet theirs.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="1586" name="1586">Goal: Sweep the Nobel Prizes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="316c" name="316c">This is one that may not seem to fit as well with the others, but it was chosen very specifically. To me, the Nobel Prizes are the best marker for the overall impact on humanity. While the money that I am trying to earn will help me, I only want to earn it by providing value to humanity. These help me keep my focus on being a force for good in the world.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a1ae" name="a1ae">I wasn’t quite sure that I ever wanted to get a PhD. I am working on my second Master’s degree, which always seemed very practical to me. I never had research that I wanted to really pursue. That changed when I fixed my mental model that I was using for Quantum Physics.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="1792" name="1792">These help me keep my focus on being a force for good in the world.</blockquote><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote" id="5607" name="5607">Physics</h4><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--h4" id="7228" name="7228"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/stop-making-quantum-mechanics-hard-e78207be80fc" href="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/stop-making-quantum-mechanics-hard-e78207be80fc" title="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/stop-making-quantum-mechanics-hard-e78207be80fc"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Stop Making Quantum Mechanics Hard.</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">It Really Isn’t.</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="d2ffda3a82ec7a2d83c9a50178c57470" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*UgYIigC_wHoX0JwuRLPbBg.jpeg" href="https://medium.com/@guinanleo/stop-making-quantum-mechanics-hard-e78207be80fc" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*UgYIigC_wHoX0JwuRLPbBg.jpeg);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="b377" name="b377">The cool part though, is by trying to hit all areas of the Nobel Prizes, I now have all sorts of research I want to work on.

It seems to have created an endless loop of content and feedback. The coolest part about all of it is that I get to use the world for feedback.
