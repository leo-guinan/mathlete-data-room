I had a similar experience this summer. I really related to a lot of the thoughts and feelings you shared. It is eye opening to realize you arenâ€™t really living your life. We block off so much of our potential due to fear. When you see yourself as part of Humanity, you realize there is nothing to fear.</p></div></div></section>
