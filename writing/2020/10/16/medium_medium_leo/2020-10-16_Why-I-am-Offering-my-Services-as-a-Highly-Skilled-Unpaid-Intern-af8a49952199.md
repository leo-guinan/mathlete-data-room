One of the things I have started to explore in my life is running my own business. I just launched it last week and am operating it as a single person consulting firm.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="acc6" name="acc6">One of the things that has stopped me from doing this sooner is the need to track down payments from clients. I have read so many horror stories about that whole process. That’s why I decided to simply not charge for my services. To some extent, I was going to offer myself as a highly trained intern.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5c2d" name="5c2d">Interns</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="ff46" name="ff46">Then I started to think deeper about it. Interns are usually early on in their careers, just getting started. Why don’t we pay them, and well? I would argue that interns are some of the highest value employees you will ever have. The reason?</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="0be2" name="0be2">They are there to learn.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="97d7" name="97d7">When somebody wants to learn something, they do. The internet has given us the ability to connect anyone to a number of teachers in any subject. At least one is likely to connect to any given person for any given subject. Therefore, we need to facilitate the learning as much as possible. Interns, being there a short time, will have a short time to work with. Therefore, they will try to absorb as much information as possible in a short amount of time. Combining this with their fresh perspective is a formula for innovation.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="35e2" name="35e2">Obstacles to Learning</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0fd4" name="0fd4">Know what doesn’t facilitate learning? Worrying about how to pay the bills. If you want to maximize the potential for your interns, pay them. Pay them well. They will generate a ton of value for you. That goes for your employees as well. They will perform much better if they don’t need to worry about how they are going to pay their bills. The internet has changed the amount of value a single person can provide. If you figure out how to maximize the potential of your employees, you will run a very successful business.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="1262" name="1262">The internet has changed the amount of value a single person can provide.</blockquote><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--pullquote" id="f6c7" name="f6c7">Future Considerations</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="6ba4" name="6ba4">Now we can start doing something pretty cool. If we start having people be financially secure in their jobs, as they gain more experience, they gain more time in their lives. This time can be used to give back. That is what my consulting business is. I am starting a business in order to give back. I don’t necessarily want to do it this way, but due to the current economic climate and legal structures, it felt like the safest way to proceed. I am keeping my regular job to continue paying the bills. That gives me some freedom to offer my skills and knowledge to others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="843e" name="843e">The assumption I am basing everything on is that people will appreciate value when it is given them. I want to provide as much value as possible in whatever time I have to work on a given problem. Value is very hard to measure at the time it is given. True value is only seen over time. This is why I offer my knowledge freely. If I provide value, that value will either be paid back to me in some way at some point in the future, or it will be paid forward into the universe. Either one works for me, honestly.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="c82c" name="c82c">Value is very hard to measure at the time it is given. True value is only seen over time.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="1984" name="1984">This allows me to help people figure out solutions to their problems. That is why I started writing software. Now I can see that software is only part of the solution. The true value is in sharing your knowledge to help others grow.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ec1d" name="ec1d"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://consulting.guinantech.com" href="https://consulting.guinantech.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Interested in following my consulting journey? Or in taking advantage of some of my knowledge and experience? Sign up for my mailing list! I don’t want to tell you how often I will send you messages. Probably not that often. But when I do, I will try to make sure they provide you maximum value.</em></a></p></div></div></section>
