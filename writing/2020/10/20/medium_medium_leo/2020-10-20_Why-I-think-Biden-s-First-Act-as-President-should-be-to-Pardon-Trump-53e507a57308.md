Much too long. It is time to release our fear.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5533" name="5533">Punishment is Inefficient</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e75f" name="e75f">We punish people for their mistakes. We are afraid of them repeating their mistakes. Punishment is not an efficient teacher though. It works, but other things work better. We know this because of science.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="03de" name="03de">His Actions Were Not His Alone</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="6bdc" name="6bdc">Trump did what he did to make money. This makes sense. We have programmed people for decades to believe that money and success were equal. They are not, and truly happy people know this.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b17e" name="b17e">He is simply a symptom of a broken economy. He thought he could fix things. He took a shot. He missed. I am championing a society that forgives. It is only through mistakes that we can learn.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d414" name="d414">I liken him to a hacker that figures out a weak point in the system and exploits it. He did it for money because money buys freedom. I think he even views money the same way I do. Debt is stupid and shouldn’t be paid. Saving is stupid because you can always get more money.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3b5b" name="3b5b">The Missing Piece</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b575" name="b575">He lost sight of something though. Sometimes, we owe debts to people. These debts can make the difference between people eating and not. These actions affect peoples’ lives. We have to be mindful of our actions and how they affect other people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9d30" name="9d30">Trump has a hard time doing that with people he is close to. There was never any hope that he would be able to successfully feel the collective emotions of a nation and lead them into prosperity. That just isn’t the way he works.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="51ae" name="51ae">I can’t blame him though. He has been built by a society that favors money over people. We are as much at fault for his failures as he is. That is why I favor pardons for everyone involved in the administration.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="03fd" name="03fd">Reasons Against Pardoning</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="30cd" name="30cd">Unless they withhold information. That is where danger lies. The game is easy to win when you can see all the pieces. It is much more difficult when you can’t. Just be honest and go free with your profits.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="be2d" name="be2d">Fixing the Loopholes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="10fe" name="10fe">I think Donald Trump served a very important purpose. He showed us the weaknesses in our system. He earned his money. He figured out all the loopholes. When you see it, you do have to appreciate it. He knows how to make money. He just doesn’t know how to do it without wreaking lives.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea83" name="ea83">Because of his example, I think I have figured out how to fix the flaws in the system that produced him. I can’t change the past but I can fix the future. Let me help you see the future that I am designing and start designing your own. The brightest future starts with forgiveness. A big show of forgiveness is what this world needs right now.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="9356" name="9356">Be the Best Boss</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="8bd5" name="8bd5">The best bosses in the world forgive mistakes. They understand that mistakes mean progress. Success is boring. Mistakes mean you are trying to do something different. Biden should be the ultimate boss.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c65" name="4c65">Biden should forgive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7b64" name="7b64">Signed,</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="f273" name="f273">Someone who may have punched you if you told me this 4 months ago.</p></div></div></section>
