I have designed a fix for society. But one thing that makes my fix easier to implement is a calm populace. Pardoning Trump removes the gas from the fire under his supporters. Emotional people do not reason well. He has stirred up their emotions for 4 years now and kept directing them towards hate.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a140" name="a140">The best way to win a fight is to not fight. By pardoning him, it pops the bubble of fiction that he has created for the last 4 years. It gives him a way to gracefully step away. It lets his supporters calm down. And it gives me more time to implement my fix.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4fc1" name="4fc1">I see two ways this could go. This is the route that is least likely to end in civil war or the end of humanity. I want the chance to rebuild what he has shown us is broken. The farther along we divide, the harder it is to bring us together.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="951c" name="951c">I analyzed both sides of everything. I looked at the world from every view point. I wanted to understand why people didn’t see the same world that I did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="953b" name="953b">Then I realized it was that they didn’t have the same information I did. So I studied how information flows over time. This has led me to several breakthroughs on the economy and quantum physics.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fa8a" name="fa8a">I realized that money has a really weird influence on society. That is weird because money is a human construct. It shouldn’t be influencing our behavior.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3870" name="3870">I want time to implement my plan. Let him get away with his money. Money doesn’t really matter. Peace matters. That is the brightest future.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="83ae" name="83ae">Thank you for reading. I do appreciate your time.</p></div></div></section>
