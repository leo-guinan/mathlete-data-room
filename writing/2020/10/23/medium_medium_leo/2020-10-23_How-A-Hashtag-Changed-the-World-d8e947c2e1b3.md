If you are not familiar, it was the ultimate David vs. Goliath story. Goliath, an out of town businessman who had bought the local professional soccer team, decided to try to extort the city by threatening to move the team. David, a group of passionate supporters, refused to let the team leave.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c323" name="c323">A long, hard struggle ensued. Regardless of Goliath’s (henceforth Goaliath because of the beautiful soccer reference in an accidental typo that I want to keep) actions, some of which were extremely shady looking, the #SaveTheCrew movement focused only on a single positive outcome. Keeping the team in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Everything else was secondary. Negative emotions and thoughts were kept away. The focus was overwhelmingly positive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6f1b" name="6f1b">Personally, I was deeply affected by events. The team (and their league) were created when I was a kid. I latched on immediately and have never let go. I have also been a lifelong Browns fan. Except when the Browns were gone. It left a hole in my life that I tried to fill with other NFL teams. They never quite stuck with me and I was right back on the Browns wagon when they returned to Cleveland.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="56dd" name="56dd">I was watching the same thing happen to me again. Except, this time, it was soccer, which I love way more than football. And I had invested a large chunk of my life in supporting this team. The ups and downs through the years. I was terrified that what I had previously experienced was going to happen to me again. This time, at a much greater impact.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7517" name="7517">Then I was saved from that fate by a hashtag. #SaveTheCrew. David stepped up against Goaliath and slayed the giant. Ok, the giant went off to his new city with a different team, but David still won.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="92ac" name="92ac">I am not going to go into specifics on the whole campaign. There has been a ton written on the details. And written by better writers than me. Go enjoy their work if you are interested in finding out more.

They harnessed the power of social media for good. They showed me how powerful the internet can be.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c05e" name="c05e">Their campaign was run with the following values (from the viewpoint of the observer, not an active participant in the campaign):</p><ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="6687" name="6687">Focus on staying positive. Negativity was actively discouraged.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="f142" name="f142">Let everybody who had the time, energy, and ability throw their skills into the ring.</li></ol><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="1d14" name="1d14">3. Rally around a single idea. In this case, a hashtag.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="dd93" name="dd93">Focus on Staying Positive</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="01d7" name="01d7">This is something that stood out to me. In a time of overwhelming negativity, they kept everyone focused on a positive outcome. As someone who has seen firsthand how easily negativity spreads and how it can affect the people it touches, I appreciate this fact more than most. It is really easy to spread negativity. Positivity is a much harder message to spread.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4752" name="4752">But it can be done. I have used this as a guide to my blogging. I ended up going negative and getting the views soon after starting. It is the easy path. But it is not the right path. I know positivity works. It just takes more time to spread.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="9b68" name="9b68">Let Everybody who had the Time, Energy, and Ability Throw their Skills into the Ring.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3b9b" name="3b9b">The movement was inclusive. If you had skills that you wanted to apply to the cause, you were accepted. The only requirement was that you wanted to keep the team local. All ideas were considered. Everything was democratic in nature. All resources were pooled and used in the most effective way possible. Everybody did their piece to the best of their ability. They trusted each other. It was easy to trust each other. Everyone was open and honest with each other. They made the movement bigger than the individual.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7247" name="7247">At the movement’s peak, it was a thing of beauty. A massive creature that moved with incredible grace. It was a worldwide event. It focused the energy of the world into a single goal. Then it brought that goal to life.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2314" name="2314">Rally Around a Single Idea. In this Case, a Hashtag.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="08d5" name="08d5">This was a beautiful masterstroke in advertising. The key to any good advertising campaign is to associate a product with an idea. The product in this case, though, was a desire for a future outcome. They created a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_brand" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lifestyle brand</a> out of an idea. The associated the hashtag with good vibes and shared goals. People wanted to join the movement. They saw the chance to aid David in his battle vs Goaliath.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="daaa" name="daaa">They wanted to jump in on the side of good (the positive) and not evil (the negative). That made me realize something. It made me realize that people are truly good at their core. I watched the numbers play out. Negativity burns bright, but it is easily stopped. All it takes to stop a chain of negativity is positive actions. Positive actions, though, they have staying power. They start off slowly, like a snowball at the top of a mountain. But over time, they gain momentum and more snow. By the time that snowball reaches the bottom, it is an avalanche. What started out as a snowball can then change the world.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="de53" name="de53">How To Change The World</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="be57" name="be57">The key to changing the world is people. A single person cannot change the world alone. A group of people focused on a single goal change the world. I have seen it first hand. I am trying to distill down the most basic lessons of this movement and apply them to other areas of my life. They work. I have used them in my life to start some big changes.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a853" name="a853">The Lessons</h4><ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4" id="9c57" name="9c57">Negativity is waste. Negativity wastes energy. Positivity creates energy. When stuck in negativity, it requires a much larger burst of positivity to break free. A large group of people using the power of positivity can rid the world of negativity.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="dde9" name="dde9">Exclusion is a waste. Like negativity, any time you exclude someone from a group who wants to be there, you cost the goal valuable resources. A big goal needs all hands on deck. Turning away help is dumb.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="7ee3" name="7ee3">No matter how crazy an idea sounds, no matter whether something has been done before or not, it is achievable in time by groups of dedicated humans. It doesn’t matter whether or not you know exactly how to achieve a goal. Some combination of skills and ideas will change the world the way you want. You just have to be willing to put them forward. People flock to big ideas that prove good can triumph over evil.</li></ol><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li graf--trailing" id="f8b0" name="f8b0">Go forward and change the world. Use the hashtag #SaveTheWorld to show your progress.</h4></div></div></section>
