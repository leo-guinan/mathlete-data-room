I realized that money isn’t quite what we all think it is. It has a deeper meaning than we typically think of.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5451" name="5451">By we, I mean the people without enough money to own their freedom. People who have to make decisions based on money, not on desire.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84b4" name="84b4">People who do have the money for freedom see a much different world. But still not the real world. Just a small view of it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="634e" name="634e">The trick to understanding money is to look at how everyone uses it. That is where I found inefficiencies.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6817" name="6817">Just think about that. Why should money influence us? Money is a human creation. Now it is affecting our society. I traced money through history. I wanted to understand how something we created could come back to destroy us.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2138" name="2138">Don’t misunderstand this point.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b3c4" name="b3c4">We are currently on a path to destruction. We need to stop before we go too far. I modeled the current state of the economy and watched where society was trending. We are currently trending towards the destruction of everything we love. I have seen this first hand.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b16c" name="b16c">I figured out how to stop this current trend. I need people to share my ideas. I don’t care if you just share my posts or write your own versions. Perhaps you design an interpretive dance to express them. I don’t want to limit you in your sharing mechanisms. I just need the ideas to spread.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="df07" name="df07"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/10/23/4-money-management-tips-for-first-time-entrepreneurs/" href="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/10/23/4-money-management-tips-for-first-time-entrepreneurs/" title="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2020/10/23/4-money-management-tips-for-first-time-entrepreneurs/"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">4 Money Management Tips for First-Time Entrepreneurs | Data Driven Investor</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Over 82% of business failures occur as a result of financial mismanagement and cash flow issues.

That is a lot of money.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a738" name="a738">It is. More than one person needs to control. It is such an astronomical amount that it unbalances the economy. Unless you spend it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f690" name="f690">So I have plans to spend it. I have several products that I intend to launch for the purposes of re-balancing the economy. I intend to structure my life such that I can maximize my efforts in helping humanity reach their next evolution.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2bfb" name="2bfb">I am currently working on trying to get connections with various funding sources. It is only a matter of time. I think if I get my foot in the door, I can show the people with money the value I can provide them. That is why I want my ideas to spread.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b691" name="b691">I only need one connection.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3369" name="3369">I need the one right connection that can open the rest of the world to me. I don’t have any yet that I can draw on. I am currently trying to build up the necessary relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1996" name="1996">I spent so long focusing on the data that I neglected my networking. I neglected human connections. I am working on that. I am getting better, albeit slowly.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6373" name="6373">The secret of life is relationships.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="42cd" name="42cd">How you relate to those around you. These are the random number generators in your life. You really do get what you put in, though. They take a seed value.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="512c" name="512c">When you prime your random number generator with positive vibes, you receive positive vibes in return. Call it karma. See it in the ideas of religion and pay-it-forward.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="85ce" name="85ce">This pattern has been observed in life and described in many different ways. It all comes down to the same thing though. Relationships with other people. Everyone is human. When we learn about our differences and understand them, great things happen. We get to experience others’ lives the way they do. They share their experiences.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e23f" name="e23f">Social media warped these relationships.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9803" name="9803">There is a reason for this. We want companies to make money. The owners of these companies want to make money. So they program computers to make them money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="099a" name="099a">Do you notice that most of the social network creators look similar? They look a lot like me actually. There is a really good reason for that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a6e1" name="a6e1">They built things for their social networks that they knew. They missed out on what the rest of the world looked like. These ideas are great in an ideal society.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ac3e" name="ac3e">Had I had the opportunity to build a social networking site 10–15 years ago, I would have tried to build the same patterns.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="70e6" name="70e6">But the world is more than one person. There are problems in society right now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e83b" name="e83b">I have studied those problems. I wanted to understand them. Then I realized we could explain them. We just needed all of the data.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d5fe" name="d5fe">The problem comes back around to money. Why is that?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e736" name="e736">Money is a creation by humans to keep score in the game of life. It hasn’t ever been fair. That isn’t what it was created to do. But it has evolved along with humanity. Ideas tend to do that. Now it doesn’t work with society. There is a simple reason for that.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="0d0e" name="0d0e">The Haves vs the Have Nots</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="dff7" name="dff7">Those with money play according to their own rules. They don’t follow the rules of society because they don’t make sense when you really have freedom. They follow just enough rules to stay out of prison. You know why? Loss of freedom.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3f6a" name="3f6a">Then there are those without money to start with. They start the game of life way behind those with money. The problem is that those with money keep telling those without to work harder. They will eventually be fine. They keep showing their money as proof. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Survivorship Bias.</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6028" name="6028">Both sides are looking at very different pictures. Then social media comes along and shows us people sharing the best parts of their lives. Some people have the freedom to do the things they want in life. Others do not. This creates friction between people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1916" name="1916">Friction causes sparks. Sparks cause fires. Fires destroy lives.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="d304" name="d304">Conflict is a non-ideal state.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c7e8" name="c7e8">It occurs when information is not shared. A lack of communication is the cause of conflict. Perfect communication can prevent conflict.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff4e" name="ff4e">But our society loves secrets. Secrets are what you have. They are how you secure the future you want when you can’t afford it. You collect secrets. Secrets are the key to the future. Think about typical clickbait: “Click to see this 1 secret that will change your life forever!”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f6f4" name="f6f4">There is a reason for this. Money has trained us to keep secrets from each other. Secrets are the path to happiness. Therefore, if we are keeping secrets to try to maximize our future, so is everyone else. Then we can’t really trust anybody. “Everybody Lies.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84d0" name="84d0">So money has trained us to keep secrets. Secrets cause conflict. Money trained us to fight each other.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="21ef" name="21ef">I propose that we call a truce.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="62e0" name="62e0">We stop fighting and we start to figure out solutions. As I said, I have some in mind. But I am also only a single person. I want to make the world a better place. I figure that everyone else does too.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dfc9" name="dfc9">So let’s stop fighting for a bit. Cooler heads will prevail. The problem is not that others are out to get you. The problem is that we have a broken society that has different rules for different people. That is what happens over time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f0aa" name="f0aa">We have all of these artifacts from times past in our laws. It is time to re-evaluate everything. We need to create a truly fair society. That is what I am trying to create. I designed it, now I just need to implement it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f027" name="f027">If this pandemic has taught me anything, it is that many of the things in life that we took as fact are, in actuality, fake constructions from previous understandings of money. I intend to use this time to disrupt the world and make it a better place for everyone.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="2749" name="2749">Won’t You Help Me?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--trailing" id="2cde" name="2cde">Gain Access to Expert View — <a class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" data-href="https://datadriveninvestor.com/ddi-intel" href="https://datadriveninvestor.com/ddi-intel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Subscribe to DDI Intel</a></h4></div></div></section>
