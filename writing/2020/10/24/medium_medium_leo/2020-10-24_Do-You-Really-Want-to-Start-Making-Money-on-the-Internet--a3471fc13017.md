This sounds like I am trying to be funny, but it is important to understand the truth of this statement. There are rivers of money flowing all over the internet. The trick is to dip your bucket in the right spot. If you do it right, it will be the easiest thing you ever do. The hard part is doing it right. That is where I come in. I can give you a map to the rivers. I can also teach you a pretty cool trick that I have figured out.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8ba0" name="8ba0">Understanding what the Rivers Are</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="6a2e" name="6a2e">When I am describing rivers of money, what I am really talking about is the flow of money through transactions. Imagine a dollar bill (or your a single note of your local currency). You can spend a dollar on something. It then goes to the person selling whatever you bought. They are the next stop on the journey. Eventually, they spend the dollar on something. The chain continues. The river flows, money through time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e0f1" name="e0f1">There is an obvious way to make money here. You have to insert yourself into the river, in between two points. What do I mean by this? You have to facilitate the transaction between buyer and seller. This means the money can flow to you and you will get to keep a cut of it as you pass it on. This can be extremely lucrative if you figure out where people are selling and having a hard time finding people buying. There are many examples of this, but one that immediately comes to mind is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/what-is-dropshipping" href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/what-is-dropshipping" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drop shipping</a>. You find someone who wants to buy something, you find someone willing to buy, and you buy from the seller and sell to the buyer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="09a0" name="09a0">This all is easy to see when discussing physical products. It does get a little harder when thinking about selling ideas. That is what digital media is. It is some new combination of ideas. This is where the trick comes in.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="1358" name="1358">My Trick</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5389" name="5389">Instead of stepping into the river, I like figuring out a better path for the river to flow.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f29d" name="f29d">Original State:</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="8c19" name="8c19"><img alt="sketch showing product rivers flowing into a market river" class="graf-image" data-height="387" data-image-id="1*_tAu6akGmiq4Imfe-rePIQ.png" data-width="572" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_tAu6akGmiq4Imfe-rePIQ.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Sketch provided by the author</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="44ba" name="44ba">When I get done:</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="0ffd" name="0ffd"><img alt="sketch showing the combining of multiple product rivers" class="graf-image" data-height="421" data-image-id="1*wJyQB3oeHp2iY78_xRBgzg.png" data-width="563" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wJyQB3oeHp2iY78_xRBgzg.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Sketch provided by the author</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="1037" name="1037">This is actually super easy to do right now. As I pointed out, we are no longer talking about physical products, although you can certainly combine those in new ways as well.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="5998" name="5998">Think about how easy it is to combine ideas.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="5878" name="5878">The trick is to figure out which combination is the most profitable. The secret answer to that problem is that if you keep trying possibilities, eventually at least one, and likely many others, will turn out to be.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="0dc8" name="0dc8">Now for some Math!</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1659" name="1659">No, please don’t go anywhere. This is really simple math, I promise. I won’t even use any numbers. Well, maybe a couple. I never remember which math some people find to be scary. If something has a chance of happening, then it will eventually happen. If you flip a coin enough times, it will eventually come up both heads and tails. You can control the probability of that by controlling the flip, but given a theoretical perfect coin flip that has a 50% chance of either heads or tails, you will eventually hit both.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="57c6" name="57c6">What does that have to do with finding the hidden internet money? Quite simply, everything.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="f4a8" name="f4a8">If you want to make real money on the internet, you need to make the money flow to you. Let’s go back to the coin flip. Now let’s change the game. Now I will give you $5 if you flip heads and nothing if you flip tails. The smart thing to do would be to just flip the coin as many times as possible to collect every heads flip you can. Tails flips don’t cost you anything. Now if we average that out, you make $2.50 per coin flip. That sounds like a good deal. That is what the internet gives us. We just don’t flip a coin.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="852d" name="852d">Making Money with the Easy Math</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="6e3b" name="6e3b">In my case, I write on Medium. Medium is my chosen medium. I write with the intention that every single post I write is going to eventually go viral. I can say this with certainty, as I believe that every post has a non-zero chance of going viral. Every single post is my coin flip, although not quite as even. All I need each post to do is go viral. This will happen eventually, assuming one thing is true.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f022" name="f022">I need to hit publish. That is the one key to having something go viral. You have to release it to the world. There are two things you can do to improve your chances of going viral. You can finely craft each piece and give each piece the highest chance of going viral.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8806" name="8806">Or, you can write a million different things and let one of them eventually hit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b8db" name="b8db">I tend to prefer the second route. It lets me create and publish with the knowledge that it will go viral eventually.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="c055" name="c055">My Process</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="8f5e" name="8f5e">Except, I then circle back and polish each of them slightly. I try to constantly raise the level of each piece, tweaking ideas as I notice issues. We have the ability to edit our posts. Take advantage of that fact. Publish the rough draft. As you go on, you will tend to find others that you like to polish before you publish. This is helpful when it comes to submitting to bigger publications. They require a higher level of content to begin with.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1394" name="1394">So I write and write and write. I try submitting to big publications and when they reject me, I publish with some smaller publications that will take most things that I write. It only takes one to go viral and start making money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="b74b" name="b74b">This is specific to how Medium pays its writers though, isn’t it?</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="8c56"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="625f" name="625f">Not really. You can extrapolate the lesson to really any sort of content creation. It only takes content resonating with enough people over time that it goes viral. The more content you create, the bigger the chance of hitting the lottery with it. This is because when you create content, you draw people to it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="618f" name="618f">People want to see what you create. Some of them might be assholes and shit all over it, but they still come to see it. The more you create, the more people you start pulling over to you. Once you gain enough people around you, the money will figure out a way to get to you. People coming to you is a sign that you are creating value for them. They will make sure that you receive value as well.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f3a5" name="f3a5">Content is the combination of ideas in a different way that is unique to you. If you want to make money, make honest content. People will relate to you. Make connections with people. Money flows through connections. If you act as a hub that connects people to your ideas, you will be able to collect value from all of them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d7f5" name="d7f5">If you really want to make money, forget about money. Focus on connecting with people. Money will come through connections. Don’t try to get money. Make it come to you. That is the secret to making money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="442d" name="442d"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://consulting.guinantech.com" href="https://consulting.guinantech.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Interested in following my consulting journey? Or in taking advantage of some of my knowledge and experience? Sign up for my mailing list! I don’t want to tell you how often I will send you messages. Probably not that often. But when I do, I will try to make sure they provide you maximum value.</em></a></p></div></div></section>
