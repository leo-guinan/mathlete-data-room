I saw an opportunity to achieve financial freedom and I jumped on it. Except, it isn’t a single opportunity, it is more of a collection of potential opportunities. I just have to figure out the right one. If one opportunity pops, that will be enough.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="bc8f" name="bc8f">As part of my plan to achieve financial freedom, I am pursuing various income streams.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="24a6" name="24a6">There is my writing on Medium. I am up to almost $100 in two months, so not quite the gold mine I was hoping for yet. I am in the process of writing a book as well. Much of my blog is going to go into the book, so at least there are multiple income streams being served by a single action of writing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2723" name="2723">I am also in the process of launching a startup. I am currently in search of funding. That is a process that is… ongoing. I think that I can convince an investor of my ideas if I can just get in the door. The doors are hard to open when you manage to find them. Unfortunately, I spent the majority of my decade in tech focusing on tech and not the people in tech. Now I have an uphill battle.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f124" name="f124">I still have my regular day job as well. I have a few ideas of opportunities I am trying to pursue within the company as well. I have a couple really cool ideas that I would like to kick off. Certain outcomes allow me to drop my own startup as well.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8309" name="8309">Lately, though, I have hit a bit of a lull. I have laid a bunch of groundwork and have to work on being patient. That is where I struggle in life. I am probably the least patient person you will ever meet. Now, there are days where it seems all I can do is wait. These days can be excruciating at times.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7047" name="7047">That is also when The Imposter shows up.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1356" name="1356">He waits for the quiet times when things are not actively happening. Then he starts whispering to me.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="7146" name="7146">“If you were good enough, you would already have succeeded.”</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="9e12" name="9e12">I have been keeping him away by working constantly. If I don’t take a break, he never has a chance to show up. But there is always a time where he can appear and he does. He is fast. It doesn’t take a long break in the action for him to show up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="1268" name="1268">When he does, we battle. I try to remove him from my head. Some days, it is easier than others. A few days lately, it has been a real struggle. I manage to eventually get him out but it is a struggle. It is a drain on my energy and motivation. Each little doubt he whispers in my ear is a bit more energy that I have to spend on ejecting him.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="3dd3"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="3206" name="3206">I can’t make him go away forever.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7ffb" name="7ffb">I know he will always be back. All I can do is battle him when he shows up, spend the energy that I need to in order to get him out, and then try to recover that energy. I can look at a number of things and see that I am on the right track. Things are moving, if not quickly enough to make me happy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d414" name="d414">That is the problem with wanting to make an impact on the world. A lasting impact takes time. It takes coordination and luck. I have a number of possible paths laid out before me. I know that most are going to fail. I just need one to get me where I need to go. Sometimes, that involves backtracking slightly and spending the time to figure out my next move.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="8810" name="8810">Even if that means The Imposter shows up. I have beat him before and I will again.</p></div></div></section>
