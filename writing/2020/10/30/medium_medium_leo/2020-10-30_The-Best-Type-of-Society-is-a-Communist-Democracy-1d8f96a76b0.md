And Democracy. And really all labels. They have so many emotions tied to them. It makes it hard to separate the underlying concepts from the label itself. When we know this, though, we can separate ourselves from the emotions associated with the words. Remove your emotions from these ideas. Understand the underlying ideas. They are all based on the same thing. They are all trying to figure out how money works.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="abba" name="abba">Now we can discuss the underlying concepts. I have been pondering the best type of government for quite a while now. I think the United States has a pretty good idea for a functioning government. I just think we can tweak it in a few places and really change the world for the better.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="3b55" name="3b55">Analysis of Current Governments and Economies</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="a6d9" name="a6d9">Forms of Government</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="07bf" name="07bf">Democracy in its pure form works very well. It allows the people to govern fairly. A representative democracy works really well. It allows the people with the most information about a problem to have the power to solve the problem.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4205" name="4205">Local problems and solutions filter up the hierarchy of government, allowing the state and federal levels to have the full picture. I think the US could conceivably ditch the Senate though. I don’t think it is needed anymore. The goals of the states should no longer diverge from the goals of the federal government.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="4dda" name="4dda">Economies of the World</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b0e7" name="b0e7">What about the economy? Capitalism has seemed to be where the US is stuck. China is doubling down on Communism though. There must be a reason. The reason is that the data says that it is the best system. That is when money reaches an equilibrium in society. We are headed there eventually given rational actors. The problem is that we are no longer rational actors. I believe that we were, up until approximately 1960. I have been building up a theory as to why this is. Basically, it is due to the invention of the computer. It changed the economy. It flipped us from an economy of scarcity to one of abundance.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="8f65" name="8f65"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/humanity-failed-the-turing-test-69c4f79a169d" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/humanity-failed-the-turing-test-69c4f79a169d" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/humanity-failed-the-turing-test-69c4f79a169d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Humanity Failed The Turing Test</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Computers Just Had the Numbers.</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="693096cc2681cc50c4ae4d0423156203" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*eubJP-gGtexKweRRQCMQuA.jpeg" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/humanity-failed-the-turing-test-69c4f79a169d" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*eubJP-gGtexKweRRQCMQuA.jpeg);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="08aa" name="08aa">That is when money as we knew it broke. The US, being in a state of growth when it happened, still has not adapted to the new economy. China sees how the world economy actually works. We do not live in a time of scarcity anymore. When we did, Capitalism made sense. It enabled a slower trickle of wealth transfer between those with money and those without. Hence the idea of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">trickle-down economics.</a> Which would be right, if the economy was still the same as it was pre-1960.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="a8e6" name="a8e6"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a" title="https://medium.com/the-innovation/its-time-to-give-the-invisible-hand-of-the-market-a-high-five-51a3360de42a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">It’s Time To Give The Invisible Hand Of The Market a High Five</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The Economy Is Broken.

What if instead of scarcity, we lived in a time of abundance? There are enough resources in the world to provide for everyone. We will eventually get there. The problem though, is that people are still hoarding their resources like they may not have enough. This is creating some weird effects in the system that is society. This is where people stop being rational actors. Rational actors in an abundant society have no need to hoard resources. They can be secure in the fact that when they have needs, those needs will be met.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="02d0" name="02d0">We are fighting back and forth over ideas from the past. We need to let go of the past. It made sense at the time. Now, though, we need to start looking forward. We need to understand exactly what worked in the past and why. Then we have to look toward the future. We can learn a lot more from the past if we stopped fighting about the ideas. Let’s just agree that some ideas from the past were good, and some were bad. We have to understand how the bad ones came to exist though. Only then can we figure out how to prevent that from happening again.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="dc27" name="dc27">Let’s Imagine The Future</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="9e4d" name="9e4d">Imagine, if you will, a world in which everyone was free. Truly free. They could go where they wanted and do what they wanted. Money was no longer an issue. If they were not happy where they lived, they could move. Out of the town, out of the state, out of the country. It doesn’t matter. Everyone is free to find their place in the world. The place that they fit perfectly.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5f89" name="5f89">Peace</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d026" name="d026">I think that would make the world a peaceful place. If everyone is free to find the place they fit, they no longer have to worry about where everyone else fits. Right now, we are trying to jockey for position. We think that the only way we fit is if we make others not fit. This is because that is what we can control. We don’t have the freedom to figure out where in the world we do fit. So we push out others to make room for ourselves. This is unnecessary in an economy of abundance. Communism should lead to peace.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2c9e" name="2c9e">Forget Ourselves</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="29eb" name="29eb">Communism would lead to peace if we could drop our egos. We are so worried about ourselves first. That is where folly lies. We all need to focus on others. If we help others, they will help us. We need to understand that we don’t need to save for the future. We need to enjoy the now. If we help others now, they will help us when we need it later. We are no longer in a time of scarcity. We aren’t going to run out of resources. We just need to allocate them properly and efficiently. The government has the ability to allocate resources to those who need them. That is what the focus of government should be.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="036b" name="036b">Things We Need to Ensure Peace</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3db5" name="3db5">We also need to stop equating financial success to moral supremacy. If someone does not currently have the same resources as you, it does not mean that they are somehow lesser. The government allocating them resources does not take from you. Understand how to live in abundance.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fddf" name="fddf">Abundance requires forgiveness too. We have to understand that, until we properly allocate resources, people are struggling for the resources they need to survive. We need to stop punishing. We need to start helping. Can we really punish anyone who is not truly acting with free will? I would argue that anyone without the resources to have a certain future does not really have free will. They are simply trying to survive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="208c" name="208c">Humanity is about having the free will to make choices. When we force someone to try to survive, we turn them into animals. They are required to act fully on instinct. If they don’t, they die. Nobody has to live like that. Again, we are in a time of abundance. Everyone should have whatever they want from life. We just need to remove the barriers.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="c933" name="c933">Competition</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="de91" name="de91">We also need to stop inefficient competition. Competition can be super valuable as a measuring stick for learning. We need to stop competing for money and survival. Again, we are in an abundant economy, This means that we don’t need to compete for survival anymore.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3ceb" name="3ceb">Information</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="07ef" name="07ef">We need to start sharing information. When we withhold information, we typically do so out of fear. Fear of rejection, fear of consequence. If there is no need for punishment, there is no fear of consequence. This allows us to freely share our information with those we deem worthy of receiving it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9b8a" name="9b8a">If we aren’t withholding information due to fear, we are doing so in hopes of profit. If you want to guarantee the maximum profit, have the best information. In an abundant economy, we shouldn’t be worried about profits. Therefore, we should be freely sharing our data with each other about how to make our lives better. If companies use our data to provide us value, that is great. I will personally give all of my data to any company that makes my life exactly what I want.</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="66d5" name="66d5"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/the-rise-of-fake-news-be8c2e32c0e" href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/the-rise-of-fake-news-be8c2e32c0e" title="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/the-rise-of-fake-news-be8c2e32c0e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Rise of Fake News</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Exploring the Origins and Futures of Fake News</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="ce24f33ab8d87edd5b7a59a454a34509" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*PD8hSR35ZxzBNLJ1" href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/the-rise-of-fake-news-be8c2e32c0e" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*PD8hSR35ZxzBNLJ1);"></a></div><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="7ad5" name="7ad5">How to Sell Your Products to Maximize Value</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="860c" name="860c">If you truly care about making the world a better place with your product, figure out a way to give it away. Find someone who has the money to get it started. Get feedback from your users. Tailor it to the general population while also offering a sufficient level of customization to allow people to make it fit them specifically. It is the ultimate trust fall. But if you prove that your idea has value, your product makes lives better, the money will always be there.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6173" name="6173">Now I am Going To Prove Everything Above</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4091" name="4091">That is the basis for my new company. I am going to offer my services for free as a consultant. I am willing to spend time with anyone troubleshooting their problem. I see this as the future and I am living it now. If I can help you, my services are yours. All you have to do is ask.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e7d8" name="e7d8">My first attempt at this is through Medium. I write here because it was easy to get started. This is simply part of the offering though. I have recently filed to create an LLC and threw up a small website. I have also started a mailing list. Please feel free to sign up at the bottom if you are interested in following my progress. I aim to be extremely transparent about my whole process. This is all an experiment based on the trends I described above. That said, I am confident of success. I know what I saw in the data. Now, it is only a matter of time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bc55" name="bc55">I am also working on a book based on all of the above ideas. If you are interested in providing feedback on my ideas throughout my process, please let me know. Also, if you have written a book and want to help me, also please let me know. I just started blogging in August. I plan to publish my book in November. I like when things get to happen in accelerated time frames. The easiest way to do that is by having help.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b2df" name="b2df">Most people try to experience success and then write about it. That is great when you want to solve a problem that has already been solved somewhere else. I prefer to try to solve problems that have not been solved before. I love to design solutions. That is what my writing is. I am trying to help everyone see my process. To help everyone see my solutions that I have come up with and how I got there. To see if my solutions can help anyone else. I have spent a long time learning how to learn and learning how to solve all sorts of problems. I have the degrees and work history to back that up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2457" name="2457">Now it is time to share my knowledge and experience.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="8cf1" name="8cf1"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://consulting.guinantech.com/consulting" href="https://consulting.guinantech.com/consulting" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Click here</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> to sign up for my mailing list and follow my consulting journey as I search for cool new problems to try to solve.
