I loved its relationship to math. This went back as far as church festivals, where I would ask my parents for a few bucks to play at the blackjack table.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb62" name="fb62">I started college right at the peak of the Texas Hold’em wave. Being in college, I also liked to drink. Drinking would get pretty expensive though, so I needed to figure out a way to make some money. I could have gotten a job.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3ab3" name="3ab3">Or I could play poker. The cool thing about Texas Hold’em being so popular is that tournaments were everywhere. They usually would be held with some portion of the buy-in going to charity or the hosting organization. When I was seriously playing, I was playing tournaments 6 nights a week.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f2b6" name="f2b6">Each tournament, you would see a lot of the same players, and it was a cool cross-section of the community too. It was college students, professors, blue-collar, white-collar, young, and old. I started developing friendships with people from all walks of life.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c8b9" name="c8b9">Looking back on my experiences, I found some lessons that I learned that have really followed me through life and shaped the person I am today.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="7091"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading" id="2edc" name="2edc">I Used How I Looked To My Advantage</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="4171" name="4171">My favorite part was bucking people’s assumptions. Back then, my sister started learning how to be a body piercer. I offered up my face as a practice ground. At my peak, I had about 20 different piercings in my face. They would expect some hardass kid. I am not a hardass — not at all. I try to be extremely friendly and welcoming towards everyone.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f2a0" name="f2a0">Watching this cognitive distortion play through someone’s mind was one of my favorite pastimes. At the poker table, this gave me an advantage. I didn’t quite understand why at the time, but looking back now, I see exactly what I was doing and why it worked.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7ba2" name="7ba2">One of the best ways to get someone to drop their carefully constructed persona is to throw some input at them that they aren’t expecting. Poker players pride themselves on keeping a poker face and not showing their emotions about their hands. If you present them with a scenario they weren’t expecting, some emotion breaks through. Once the emotional dam springs a leak, it is almost impossible to keep anything fully hidden. There will always be small indicators. I used this to my advantage.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="c7b3" name="c7b3">Try To Always Start from a Level Playing Field</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="694b" name="694b">I always found myself drawn to tournaments. I played some cash games, but I usually didn’t do as well. Those games were dominated by the people who had the bankroll to play the long-term game. I was focused on short-term beer money. I liked the fact that tournaments started everyone at the same level. It put more of a focus on skills over one’s bankroll. It also helped me keep money and poker separate. Money to a poker player is nothing more than a way to keep score. For me, this was easier to develop when my chips didn’t match up directly to the cash I was using. I got really good at not caring about money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7b2a" name="7b2a">My finances later in life back that up.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="3aba" name="3aba">Your Actions Reveal Your Priorities</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="48b8" name="48b8">But I did care about poker. I cared a lot. I started reading every book I could find on the subject. I wanted to figure out how the best players played. I wanted to be one of the best so I studied the best. I figured out how to calculate the odds for a given hand. I worked extremely hard to understand probabilities and make sure that I was making the right play even if the payoff never came.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="95b5" name="95b5">That is a hard lesson to learn. Sometimes, you can play the hand perfectly and you still lose.</blockquote><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote" id="f548" name="f548">Figure Out a Way To Get In the Game</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="7c95" name="7c95">I played a lot of hands. I played big tournaments and small tournaments. I never won anything huge. I did win the smaller tournaments on a relatively regular basis though. On average, I was making between $100-$400 a week, although I did go through some patches where I didn’t win much. I never tried to build up a bigger bankroll though. All I needed was the buy-in for the next tournament. Those were usually $20-$50. The way I got that money when I was in a dry spell? I sold plasma. Resourceful college student here.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="1e89" name="1e89">Understand the Consequences of Your Actions</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="37af" name="37af">If you are thinking to yourself that this seems like a lot of time and resources for a college student to spend on gambling, you are 100% correct. I focused a ton on poker. I think I saw a potential path to going pro. But I never had a shot. I didn’t have the long-term planning I needed to make that work. I was focused on short-term goals. I figured I just needed to hit one big win.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bd52" name="bd52">That’s not really how life works though.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="c911" name="c911">One Big Win is a Series of Small Wins</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="9f3c" name="9f3c">That one big win is almost always the result of a series of smaller wins put together to make a big one.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a12a" name="a12a">If I had taken my smaller winnings and built them up instead of spending it on beer, I probably could have gone pro. I could have built up the necessary bankroll to play in larger and larger games. I read about people doing just that. I even saw it in some other people. They were much better at that part than I was. I was focused only on my short-term happiness instead of my long-term plans.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="978c" name="978c">No Matter How Deep You Go, You Can Climb Out</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="d7c2" name="d7c2">My college seemed to think I was spending a lot of time on poker too. That probably had a lot to do with them throwing me out for a year.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="26ca" name="26ca">I pretty much didn’t focus on school at all. I thought I would be able to breeze through college the same way I did high school. That was not quite the case. I was pretty good at bluffing though and managed to convince the school not to kick me out on multiple occasions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9ed3" name="9ed3">That was a great way to get my GPA even lower. Nothing like digging yourself a nice deep hole to get out of. I have made a bit of a habit of that. That is actually what got me away from poker. I eventually came back and finished my degree with a 2.3ish GPA. Now I am working on my second master’s degree and have a 4.0. Priorities matter. When you focus on what you truly want, you can be successful.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="6772" name="6772">You Never Know Everything</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="1ae8" name="1ae8">I thought I was smart. I had been playing a bit of online poker, and while I didn’t have much money in it, I threw a few bucks at it here and there. I would inevitably lose whatever I put in though. I would have some success and try to advance too quickly. Then I noticed something. I realized that I could deposit money in my poker account without it leaving my checking account immediately.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="71d1" name="71d1">One night, I decided to take advantage of this fact. I told myself that I would pull money out of my account that I didn’t have, play for a bit and win some, and then withdraw the money. That would allow me to grow a bankroll on my poker account without actually having the money to begin with.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="69e2" name="69e2">Anybody think this sounds like a terrible idea?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c34e" name="c34e">It was.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="ef7a" name="ef7a">How I Lost $700 Then Made It Back</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="de10" name="de10">I blew through my first $100 that I put in. And the second $100. And the third.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f9ed" name="f9ed">I ended up down $725 and I decided to throw one last $25 at it. That’s when I started winning. I made every last dollar back and then a couple on top. I took that $25 and turned it into just a bit over $750. I withdrew it from my poker account and put it back in my bank account. I did it. I won. That night felt absolutely incredible. I beat the odds.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="48ce" name="48ce">Things Don’t Always Go To Plan</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="0fb6" name="0fb6">Then reality struck. I told you I didn’t really get money out of my account that often? Turns out, the time it took for money to go from your checking account to the poker account was not equal to the time it took for money to go the other way. This still doesn’t make sense to me, but now I am at least aware. I had every single withdrawal hit the next day. The deposit back to my account? Took a week.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="344a" name="344a">The bank hammered me with fees. I ended up down about $700 in fees alone. It wouldn’t have been quite as bad if I did it as bigger transactions, but I kept making transactions of $25 or $50. I convinced myself that was the way to go. Lessons learned. Nothing quite like going back to your parents and explaining this awesome gambling story and then asking them to help.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="f104" name="f104">Don’t Let Money Drive You</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="51c4" name="51c4">I have played once since then. I was working in England for a few weeks at one point and wandered over to the casino in the town I was in. I entered a tournament and played for about 6 or 8 hours. It was a ridiculous tournament. I started playing at around 8 in the evening and finished up in the wee hours of the morning. I ended up at the final table and made about $200. It was really cool to go back and experience poker a different way.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c570" name="c570">I was doing it for the fun of it alone and not worried about the money involved. That freed me up to enjoy the poker for the poker.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="2a88"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="b8a1" name="b8a1">Overall, poker taught me one lesson that rises above the others — you can only control your own actions. You can watch the actions of others to guess their intent, but you can’t ever control them. The outcome is almost never guaranteed. That isn’t where you make your money. You make money over time by making the best decisions over and over. You refine your play so that you can better understand and react to the play of those around you. But the payoff is never guaranteed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2025" name="2025">All you can do is put yourself in the best position to win over and over again and create your own luck by being slightly better at betting the odds than everyone else and changing the odds when you can.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="a45c"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="134c" name="134c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The Mini Post-Grad Survival Guide</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="e50b" name="e50b">A 5-day email course with tips on budgeting, investing, and productivity for 20-somethings. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://morning-darkness-5176.ck.page/75ec2d5152" href="https://morning-darkness-5176.ck.page/75ec2d5152" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sign up for free</a>.</p></div></div></section>
