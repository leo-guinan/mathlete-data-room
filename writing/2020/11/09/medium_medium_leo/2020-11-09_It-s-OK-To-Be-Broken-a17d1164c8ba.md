It is something I have had to come to terms with lately. My thoughts and actions do not align. They haven’t for some time. I keep trying to bring them into alignment but I am not there yet.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc34" name="cc34">I have tried medication. Medication made the problem different. It didn’t fix it. But that was on me. I was trying to fix a symptom not the actual problem. I wasn’t able to see the actual problem because I was only looking at the current state of my life. I wasn’t considering how past events influence future outcomes. I was living only in the moment, trying to survive one moment to the next. I stopped living and started thinking. At some point, I just put life on autopilot. It didn’t make any sense to me anymore so I just stayed in my head. I let others tell me what their needs were and I helped them where I could. The only way I made a choice that benefited me was if it also benefited everyone around me. I decided that I was broken because my thoughts didn’t always match my actions. Therefore, I couldn’t be trusted about what I like. I had to listen to society. I kept hearing that anything I did must be judged in the court of public opinion. So I needed to consider how the world looked at every action. It made me risk-averse. I couldn’t grow at the rate I wanted because I kept trying to take risks to grow faster and I kept getting shut down. So the only way to fix my mind was in my mind.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a220" name="a220">The more I read, the more I think that I am someone that would now be considered autistic. And I am starting to emerge from my shell and rejoin the world. I am hyper-sensitive to the emotions of others. The problem is that I reflect strong emotions whenever I am near them. If you yell at me, I don’t react well.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a1fd" name="a1fd">At least if I am close to you. One thing I got really good at was putting up emotional shields. I got so good in fact that I blocked off my own emotions. I did everything in my power to make everyone around me happy. That kept emotions down so I could stop being overwhelmed. It also kept me from really connecting fully to anyone. I created small connections with people because I couldn’t handle the full emotion of the internet, especially now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b54" name="1b54">And then I let the internet in. I used Twitter to create a bunch of small, deep connections to people. The problem is that I tried to do so in a very emotional time. I succeeded in creating a bunch of small connections. But those small connections ended up creating a torrent of emotions that I couldn’t stop.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d910" name="d910">Luckily I discovered writing and instead of processing the wave of emotion myself, I wrote. I ended up taking the raw emotion of the internet and writing what was essentially propaganda because I knew it would cause the emotions in others that I was feeling.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1758" name="1758">It sure did. I pissed a ton of people off. And that was on me. I was completely overwhelmed by emotions and I reflected that back in my actions. I watched the reactions to my emotions that I poured into my writing and I started to understand the internet better.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2438" name="2438">I realized that the internet is full of broken people just like me. We are all broken because society is broken. It will take time, but we can fix society. We are well on our way. I actually have a few ideas to move this along, now that I understand where I am broken and how broken I am.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3048" name="3048">Understanding ourselves requires us to break ourselves down to our most basic components. I personally think it is a combination of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ego death</a> and selfishness. That journey is unique for everyone though, so I don’t want to prescribe the way to do it. Once we break ourselves down to the basic building blocks of self, we begin to see what we can fashion out of those pieces.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e556" name="e556">Just remember that we are all broken. We all screw up. But we can fix ourselves. The first step to fixing ourselves is to understand ourselves. That is finally what I am starting to do. It is a hard process but the future is bright.</p></div></div></section>
