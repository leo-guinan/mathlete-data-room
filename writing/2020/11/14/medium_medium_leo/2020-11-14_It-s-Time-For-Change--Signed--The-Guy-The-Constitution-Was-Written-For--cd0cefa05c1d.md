Nope, sorry. I am getting ready to turn 35. According to the Constitution, then I will be old enough to run this country. Also, I am a white straight male. So it is pretty much my birthright, right? I grew up in middle-class middle America. I followed all the rules. Or at least most of them. Of course I did. They were written for me.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="356b"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="6aeb" name="6aeb">I Followed the Rules</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9698" name="9698">I did exactly what I was supposed to, if on my own timeline. I graduated high school, went to college, eventually graduated, and started a family. I did it with debt. That’s just how you do it. Eventually, you will be able to pay it off.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b21" name="1b21">I have done everything the way I am supposed to. I went to college. I got my degree. Hell, I got another degree and I am working on a third. Why? Gotta get away from that debt. Push it off until you can pay it later. I followed the conservative economic ideas of how to run my life. The rules gave me an easy path forward so I followed them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6106" name="6106">My career advanced and well. I figured out the rules of corporate America. I made myself conform. That was the path to freedom, right? It was working, albeit slower than I would have liked. It seemed like no matter how far I advanced, I couldn’t get out ahead of the debt I had accumulated. The debt was an anchor that kept me in place. That’s why I am still in the same rental house almost a decade later and never managed to make home ownership happen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="adf9" name="adf9">Could I have done things differently and made that a different priority? Sure, but I was following the rules of society which told me that it I just kept working I would be guaranteed the American dream. And I was advancing. Just at a slow rate.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="58ba"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="145c" name="145c">I Observed the World</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5c3c" name="5c3c">Then I looked at the world around me. I saw that everyone else was advancing their lives at different rates. I tried to understand what I was doing wrong. I have a tendency to be impatient. One of the things I have discovered about myself is that when I get impatient, I start learning. I try to figure out the fastest way to accomplish my goals and then I keep iterating over ideas until I reach whatever goal I am focused on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="34cd" name="34cd">So I studied people who were successful financially. I wanted to see the world through their eyes. There are a lot of different ways to make money. I wanted to start cycling through ideas but I needed to gain a lot of different ideas so I could look through them and try to figure out the fastest route.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="90c1" name="90c1">The fastest way to make money? Lie. Or rather, creatively present some idea as truth as a way to induce some emotion in someone. AKA advertise. That is why snake-oil salesmen exists. All advertising with no actual product to sell. There is no need to continue to provide value once you get paid. It is all about the one-time “value” you sell, but never provide. This can make you rich but it is a constant hustle. You have to constantly find new marks. Frankly, it is exhausting and takes more effort than actually building something that provides true value to people.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="9676"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="a8b3" name="a8b3">I Tried to Make Money</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1728" name="1728">When I started writing, I did so as a way to make extra money. Multiple income streams are the key right? The best way to get clicks is to appeal to peoples’ emotions and manipulate those emotions. So I wrote an article that was crafted to incite rage and used social media to drop it in front of the people I was trying to piss off. It worked really well. I got about 200K views over a single weekend. I made a few bucks from it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="084c" name="084c">But I lost what I had when I started writing, which was a desire to provide value to people through my writing. That piece offered little in the way of value. I focused on making money fast and that was the fastest way. It isn’t the best way to make money long-term, though.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="a2f6" name="a2f6">That’s when I started looking at the rules that govern our lives and how they have affected people’s behaviors. That’s when I started to see my privilege for what it really is. I can follow the rules easily because they were written for me. I haven’t had to fight my whole life again unfair systems. The systems were designed to make my life easier and they kinda did, if not necessarily better.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="821c"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="ec96" name="ec96">I Analyzed the System</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="59d2" name="59d2">I am a software engineer. When I start examining a system, I like to poke at the boundaries that are set at the edges of the system. This is where weak points usually hide. A well-defined system is one in which the boundaries have been carefully examined and carefully placed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4036" name="4036">A society is a system of people. The rules of a society (or laws of a government) determine what is acceptable within that society. The society then rewards people for following the rules by allowing them to partake in the benefits of society. But what happens when following the rules of society doesn’t get you the benefits of that society?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c60" name="4c60">The social contract is broken. I really like how Trevor Noah spelled out the social contract from the perspective of those for whom the contract doesn’t work. I will let him explain that part.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="3869" name="3869"><iframe frameborder="0" height="393" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v4amCfVbA_c?feature=oembed" width="700"></iframe></figure></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="a574"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="35d7" name="35d7">I Found the Root Cause</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1956" name="1956">What is the problem? We are dealing with the rules of a society written in 1776. It has been updated over time to reflect the changes in our understanding of the human condition and things have been getting better over time. The problem is that things have been getting better a little bit at a time and slow improvement is a painful process for those impacted by the process.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7236" name="7236">There is a fundamental problem slowing down our change. Fear. Humans that are in the ruling class are afraid that them losing power will result in a loss of comfort. This leads them to push back against change and resist it. They don’t want others to succeed now while costing them their own personal future.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7b74" name="7b74">The problem is that this isn’t how societies function. A working society produces more value than all of the humans individually can produce. It is a force multiplier on human value. It is worth investing in an inclusive society because that is the most productive. It is basic math. If you help every single person maximize the value they can provide to the world, the overall value of humanity will likewise be maximized.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="d1ff"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="1f9b" name="1f9b">I Determined the Inefficiencies</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3141" name="3141">Racism, sexism, and discrimination of any kind is an inefficient way to live. If you stop trying to stop others from getting help and achieving their goals, you are contributing to the breaking of society. I vote that we crack down on these ideas. That is what the math tells me. That said, if you are willing to follow the new rules of society, I welcome you with open arms and would love to show you how to live a productive inclusive life. That is where the idea of forgiveness comes in. A broken rule is a symbol that something in the system is broken. Why do people break the rules? To advance themselves.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ec58" name="ec58">We need to come up with a new system. Or at least drastically reduce the system we have. It is full of rules that are broken constantly. The system as a whole is completely broken and everyone is trying to figure out whichever loopholes they can in order to get ahead. This is a terribly inefficient use of time.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6eaf" name="6eaf">I Figured Out the Optimal Solution</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="8535" name="8535">The fastest way forward is to work together. Left and right. All inclusive. Stop fighting and start working together to figure out a better way. We all see that the system is broken. Stop fighting progress and start shaping progress. That is the way to guarantee your future. Make it yourself. Just stop forcing your ideas on others. What works for one may not work for another. An inclusive society will yield more than enough resources for everyone. Be a part of that solution.</p></div></div></section>
