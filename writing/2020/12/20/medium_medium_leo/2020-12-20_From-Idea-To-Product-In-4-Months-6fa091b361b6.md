I started diagramming on my whiteboard. I thought I could design a better social media app than what currently existed. I didn’t know how this idea was going to change my life, but it certainly did.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3a9b" name="3a9b">The Idea</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4" id="2bca" name="2bca"><img class="graf-image" data-height="4096" data-image-id="0*4LFx8HeAoCZDL7C6" data-unsplash-photo-id="9upRLljfKP8" data-width="6144" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4LFx8HeAoCZDL7C6"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@frankvex?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@frankvex?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Frank Vessia</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="bc78" name="bc78">One of the things that I noticed in my newly found time working from home during the pandemic is the power of social media. I didn’t realize how much I needed human connection. I had apparently relied on that from work more than I realized. As a solitary person by nature, working from home was initially great. But it started to wear on me. So I figured out ways to pass the time. Spending time with my wife and kids was great. But I ended up with a lot of extra time, too. Over the years, my hobbies have dropped off. I pretty much had work and family time. There wasn’t much time or energy left outside of that. But now I no longer had a minimum commute of 2 hours. I also didn’t have the social aspect of work that tends to take up more time than we typically realize. But now, all of this filler was gone, and I had to figure out what to do with my extra time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6573" name="6573">So I picked up extra work for my employer. The best part of this (for them, at least) was that I was on salary, so my extra work didn’t even mean that they needed to pay me more. I was gunning for a promotion, so it seemed like it was worth it. I started helping out on multiple teams.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1069" name="1069">I also started blogging. One of the things I was hoping to improve was my communication skills. I also thought I could make a few bucks doing so, so it seemed like a good use of my time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8b0b" name="8b0b">I managed to go viral about a month after I started writing. But I did so in a way that I am not proud of. Essentially, I wrote an intentionally incendiary piece and used social media to drop it into conversations that I knew would get me clicks. My interest in social media was growing around this time. I had seen a lot of hate spreading and I blew up with it. I channeled my fury into an article that was intended to cause more fury.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8c9b" name="8c9b">And it did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="444b" name="444b">It did that quite well. In the course of a week, I racked up almost 200K views, I was mentioned twice on national talk radio, and I received literal hate mail (as in snail mail, not just email).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="06bd" name="06bd">Also, my social media was a cesspool. I ended up getting rid of it entirely for a while. There just didn’t seem to be any redeeming it from what it had become, which is something that really wasn’t me. So I killed it all. This gave me even more free time!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="03f5" name="03f5">I had to reflect on my actions and what led to them. It seemed that the culprit was mostly the combination of social media and trying to make money. This juxtaposition was the spark of my idea.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="0fb8" name="0fb8">The Research</h3><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3" id="4a75" name="4a75"><img class="graf-image" data-height="3840" data-image-id="0*M42zOGNhAfVbMR7l" data-unsplash-photo-id="L9EV3OogLh0" data-width="5760" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*M42zOGNhAfVbMR7l"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@f7photo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@f7photo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Michael Longmire</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="9a3a" name="9a3a">Now I had something. I also had some time to research. I used my writing as a way to outline some of my ideas, my goals, and my research. I focused a lot of my time on money, how humans relate to money, and how this affects behaviors on social media.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ac82" name="ac82">It turns out, more people use social media to try to make money than I realized. Until I truly threw myself into the world of social media as a creator, I didn’t completely understand it. Now I see the level of effort it takes to monetize your creations. Doing it on social media well takes time and effort.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="d1fa" name="d1fa">Money + Tech = Advertising</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9119" name="9119">One of my main areas of focus was on the practice of advertising, which social media amplified. The more I learned, the more I hated the practice. I think that the way it is currently done is an inefficient use of time and money and is more destructive to the human psyche than it is helpful. That said, I completely understand how it came to be the way it did. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-death-of-the-traditional-advertising-agency-model-60ada45180a" href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-death-of-the-traditional-advertising-agency-model-60ada45180a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">But the advertising model as we know it is starting to shift.</a> I wanted to get out ahead of this shift.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="15f7" name="15f7">From that article by Bob Morris, one part sticks out. One of the themes he found in advertising:</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="0abd" name="0abd"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Interruptive vs. Additive </strong>for the end customer / consumer</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="2262" name="2262">I have hated ads since the earliest days of the popup. They are always just getting in the way. I somehow manage to get work done despite the ads everywhere. They don’t add anything to my life. I figured out my target. I was going to destroy advertising.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e6a8" name="e6a8">Except, advertising works, right? And it does help us become aware of new products that we may enjoy. So not everything about advertising is bad. What I really needed to do was distill advertising down into its component parts and rebuild something I no longer hated.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="08d2" name="08d2">My Day Job</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="2eed" name="2eed">As I was doing this research, I realized that there could be some big initiatives I could try to launch at work. In addition to working on multiple teams, now I was also trying to start my own. I got buy-in throughout the company. I had a meeting scheduled with a VP talking about my development plan. I got a bit nervous and did a terrible job pitching him my ideas. But after telling me that the company would own the IP of anything I built going forward, he said something to me that I don’t think I will ever forget.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="a4fd" name="a4fd">If you really think you have something, you should go for it.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="9e1b" name="9e1b">I quit the next day.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="d18f" name="d18f">Running A Business</h3><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3" id="0d0b" name="0d0b"><img class="graf-image" data-height="3840" data-image-id="0*ih1E54K23ulIaHxb" data-unsplash-photo-id="8YG31Xn4dSw" data-width="5760" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ih1E54K23ulIaHxb"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@brucemars?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@brucemars?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">bruce mars</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="8946" name="8946">Now what? I didn’t have much of a runway, cash-wise. I was (and still am) the sole earner for my family and I had to come up with a way to make it on my own. I started talking with potential investors. I thought they would just throw money at me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8e1a" name="8e1a">Turns out, it is a bit harder than that. I have spoken with some VC firms. I have a couple meetings coming up. But I can’t afford to wait on these bigger checks. I had to figure out how to make money, and soon.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6c34" name="6c34">I realized that I should just build a single product. I have a whole ecosystem in my head for the eventual corporation I will build out. But all of that means nothing if I can’t figure out how to make enough money to get it to that point.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a9ec" name="a9ec">Did I mention that this was a lot harder than I thought?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d30d" name="d30d">But I didn’t have a choice, now. I just kept working. I kept designing. I kept talking to people. I found some users. I spoke with more potential investors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d099" name="d099">And now, four months after that spark of an idea, I have my first product. It isn’t much, just a Substack newsletter that I am using for my first round of investments, to gather more data, and to generate interest in my product.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="55f6" name="55f6">But damn it, it’s my first product. It’s technically launched, with about 10 subscribers at the time of this writing. Maybe it will eventually die out. Maybe it will become huge. Time will tell.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="9fc6" name="9fc6">But my life will never be the same.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="8341"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="c9b5" name="c9b5"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://leoguinan.substack.com/" href="https://leoguinan.substack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Want to help me grow my product?
