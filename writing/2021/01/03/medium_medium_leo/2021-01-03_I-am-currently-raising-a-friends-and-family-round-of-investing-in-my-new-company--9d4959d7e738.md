I have studied how social media companies have a tendency to exploit their users’ data and I want to create a social media platform that rewards its users and helps them instead of preying on them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="594a" name="594a">With tech startups, it is common to start by raising initial investments from friends and family. I wanted to reach out and offer this opportunity to you to be among the initial investors. Since I don’t officially have a company that has stock yet, I will be using a document called a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE). If you decide to invest, just let me know the amount and I will create a SAFE for you to sign.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="eaf8" name="eaf8">After this initial investment, nothing else needs to be done from your side until I raise my first priced round of investing from Venture Capital firms and individuals. I have been in discussions with several and am hopeful that I will be able to raise my first priced round in the next 2–4 months. At this point, your SAFE will be converted into shares in my company and will require a signature from you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="59a8" name="59a8">There is considerable upside to being among my first investors and also some risk. The upside is that I will be offering shares to you at a discount price. When your SAFE converts into shares, it will be at the initial price point that I am setting. You will receive a number of shares in the company based on buying at this set price while the bigger investors will be buying some at a higher price. As far as risk goes, this is a very early stage company. I have a ton of faith in my ideas and in my abilities to turn this into a successful company. But there is no guarantee of any returns.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6a81" name="6a81">I am currently raising money at a valuation of $1,000,000. Based on market trends, I expect my priced round to be raised at a $4–10 million valuation. So any investment now will get hopefully get you 4–10x as much stock as it would in a couple months.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0330" name="0330">Because I haven’t officially created all of this stock yet, I can accept investments of any size from anybody. YCombinator, the group that put together the SAFE, is one of the premier startup incubators on the planet. They made the early fundraising process as simple as possible. At this point, every little bit helps. I have started to pull a team together and I plan on using these initial investments to start building up some of the infrastructure of the company.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="98bd" name="98bd">Thanks in advance for any investments! If you have any questions about what I am doing, please feel free to email me at leo@guinantech.com. I also have a small landing page put together that outlines some of the basic ideas around the company I am building: <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://definet.guinantech.com/" href="https://definet.guinantech.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://definet.guinantech.com/</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d4a4" name="d4a4">SAFE Reference: <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/</a></p></div></div></section>
