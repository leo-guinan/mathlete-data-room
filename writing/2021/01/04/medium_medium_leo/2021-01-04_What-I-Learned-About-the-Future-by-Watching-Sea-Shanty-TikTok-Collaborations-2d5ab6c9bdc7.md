I started on social media in its earliest days. I had a Myspace. I joined Facebook when it was just for college students. I was on Twitter in its earliest days.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2987" name="2987">Then social media exploded. Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok. To be honest, I just didn’t understand the appeal. I thought I was just aging out of social media. I had a career and a family and simply wanted to spend time elsewhere. I tried Instagram and Snapchat but they never clicked for me. I have avoided TikTok, instead relying on my Twitter feed to occasionally show me videos.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d559" name="d559">Then came a Twitter thread that completely warped my understanding of TikTok. It featured a sea shanty. I have always enjoyed a good sea shanty. Turns out, I am not the only one. Here is the first video I saw on the thread.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="fb1e" name="fb1e"><iframe frameborder="0" height="700" scrolling="no" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6910995345421962498" width="340"></iframe></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="ff43" name="ff43">And that video was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it. But the thread kept going.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="4889" name="4889"><iframe frameborder="0" height="700" scrolling="no" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6911209793847905541" width="340"></iframe><figcaption class="imageCaption">Join us as we rise.</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="0258" name="0258">And going.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="65d0" name="65d0"><iframe frameborder="0" height="700" scrolling="no" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6912168646802541829" width="340"></iframe></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="1e86" name="1e86">And I was blown away. A thread of sea shanties finally led me to understand the power of TikTok. I downloaded the app and spent about an hour watching mostly sea shanties.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="860a" name="860a">The secret of TikTok? Social media + collaboration. It mirrors the trends I am watching in software development. The rise of APIs. Not only do you build something, you allow others to build off of your work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e93a" name="e93a">This is a big contrast to corporate software development, which is where I spent the past decade. We kept our work internal. It is actually something that I am trying to overcome in being a startup founder. My work isn’t known. I have to prove myself all over again. My biggest regret at this stage in my career is that I didn’t build more in public.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="832d" name="832d">But that has changed. I am building everything in public now. Because when you build in public, people can build off of your work. And then your work can reach new heights. Collaboration is the future. Not competition.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7fca" name="7fca">There is plenty of money in the world. Holding tightly to IP is a good way to get lost in the shuffle. You don’t get to see how great your work could be. Companies believe that keeping their software internal results in the greatest competitive edge. That competitive edge leads to the biggest profits.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6c5f" name="6c5f">Those companies are wrong. What ends up happening is that the systems end up creating profits for some, usually those at the top of the company. Because these companies teach that secrets lead to profits, they end up filling the highest levels of the company with people who like to keep secrets.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e1a2" name="e1a2">I plan to show that this model is broken. There is a massive shift coming. The era of corporate competition is coming to an end. The era of collaboration is starting to rise. When you keep secrets to make money, it becomes easier to bend the rules. And when you start bending the rules, it becomes easier to break them. As long as nobody finds out, you get to keep making money, right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7697" name="7697">That approach has led us to the world we live in. But a new world is rising. One in which we focus on advancing the human race and not individuals. A rising tide lifts all boats.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c568" name="c568">DeFiNet plans to be the tide. Let’s collaborate our way to a brighter future. And as the tide rises, we can sing some sea shanties on TikTok.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="9655"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="2b4d" name="2b4d"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://personal.guinantech.com/journey" href="https://personal.guinantech.com/journey" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Join us as we rise.</em></a></p></div></div></section>
