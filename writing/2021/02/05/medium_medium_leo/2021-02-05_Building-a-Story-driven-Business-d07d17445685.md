They formed in response to the pandemic and are a group of volunteers building things to help people locally with technology. Through this group, I discovered a project that called themselves Remote Hugs. They invited me to a meeting and asked for my thoughts regarding their current status.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c8cf" name="c8cf">They had developed an app called <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hugs.care/" href="https://hugs.care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hugs</a>. Their initial goal was to help those working in homeless youth shelters find a way to reconnect with the kids they worked with. The people they tested with loved it. But there was a problem.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d65a" name="d65a">The app was made for a phone. This wasn’t something kids in a homeless shelter reliably had. So the team asked the question, “Who is this for?” They invited me to help them answer that question.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8c7c" name="8c7c">I helped the team come up with a social media strategy. We saw that there was National Hugging Day in January so we set that as a target. It seemed like a perfect fit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="053a" name="053a">Before I continue, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the team. I don’t think I have been part of such a wholesome team. They are all just amazing people. They are building this because they feel that it makes the world a better place. I think it does too.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="145a" name="145a">We tossed around some ideas about the exact nature of the strategy. In the end, we put together content for several platforms to promote our app. I will share those in a later post because I love the artwork that John put together.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d4be" name="d4be">One of the ideas was to try to build interest in the campaign ahead of time. Mat talked about what the app meant to him in an interview with a local TV station. We sent out some snippets to a few newsletters we are familiar with.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bb7" name="4bb7">While we were building all of this, I was also trying to get DeFiNet off the ground. I thought that I could time my launch with National Hugging Day, get subscribers, and be profitable the next day. I pledged some money to the youth shelters that the team started off helping if we were able to get enough users. I was ready for everything to take off.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="89b0" name="89b0">In the end, users for the Hugs app increased 200%. Which sounds great.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0777" name="0777">But we still have fewer than 100 users. Which isn’t great.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf25" name="bf25">Also, to make things better? Turns out, my site wasn’t actually accepting subscriptions. The old “turn it on and it works” feature didn’t. I didn’t even think to test it. I just assumed it would work like it was supposed to. Which was really dumb. Pretty much the opposite of what you should do if you are planning something like a huge launch. This was on Thursday.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c7d5" name="c7d5">I got subscriptions working on Sunday. The way I had structured my site and hosting just didn’t support the subscription function. I still don’t know exactly why. I ended up moving the whole thing onto Ghost’s managed site.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c284" name="c284">The following day was day one of the GSV Startup Bootcamp. It was also the day we met to talk about the results of National Hugging Day. Which were not good.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="db71" name="db71">I had spent some time analyzing what I felt the next step should be. Even before we got the confirmation of our numbers, I had the feeling it wasn’t going to be what we had hoped for.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0172" name="0172">As I wrote about yesterday, our emotional rocket crashed and burned. We put a ton into this effort to get less than 100 new users. It felt like a huge failure.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9324" name="9324">I noted the spike we got. It may not have been huge, but it was noticeable. We found some new users. We put together a plan to try to gather some more information about these users so we could talk to them. I wanted to write a blog about the idea as a way to see if we could find some new users that way. A blog much like this one. I was trying to decide which way I wanted to take it. And then Mat sent me a message. Here it is, with permission of the author (last names redacted):</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="ae8c" name="ae8c"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Good Morning!</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="f881" name="f881"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I do not have a question or need support but am writing today to offer feedback.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="3163" name="3163"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I recently became aware of your app and the background of its creation through a mutual connection, Mat.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="8838" name="8838"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">There is no doubt that you already understand the intrinsic value of this app and its message, but I wanted to reach out to thank you for creating it and to let you know how it has been useful in my practice.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="4db6" name="4db6"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">I work as a paralegal in guardianship and estate administration and have several clients who face challenges mentally and physically, which have only been exacerbated by this pandemic. This app has allowed them to be expressive in a way that transcends the message of an emoji. The fact that there is some energy involved in both sending and receiving the hug is, perhaps by design but nonetheless, priceless. It is my belief that the transfer of that energy can actually be felt.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="0c0a" name="0c0a"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Often we fail to acknowledge the small things that make a difference in our work and personal lives, and I did not want this opportunity to pass. I have copied Mat on this for bringing it to our attention via Linkedin.</em></blockquote><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote" id="84f8" name="84f8"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments.

To me, this shows that we have something. We didn’t reach many people. But we connected with someone.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="56ae" name="56ae">Ok, so how do we find more Karens?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7e08" name="7e08">That’s one question. But before we answer that one, let’s talk money.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="6eeb" name="6eeb">The Money Problem</h3><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3" id="4fad" name="4fad"><img class="graf-image" data-height="3456" data-image-id="0*1mt72amQKtWZdldz" data-unsplash-photo-id="pElSkGRA2NU" data-width="5184" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1mt72amQKtWZdldz"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@blankerwahnsinn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@blankerwahnsinn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Fabian Blank</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="8ce0" name="8ce0">This was a difficult problem. We had access to some resources through a local foundation but nothing endless. We had some individuals work together to produce an app that there is just a little bit of interest for?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="153f" name="153f">I hate advertising, personally. I understand the need for it but I feel it has definitely crossed some boundaries. And it just didn’t seem right to have ads in the app.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7fd4" name="7fd4">We didn’t want to charge for the app. With an initial target of homeless youth, that’s not something that we wanted to pursue.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="916c" name="916c">Freemium? Maybe, but just not something we really wanted to build.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2dda" name="2dda">So is there a way to make it sustainable?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="243c" name="243c">I think there is. And I think the way to make it sustainable is the same thing we can do to attract more Karens.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3aef" name="3aef">In the last 6 months, I have been focusing on writing with a focus on blogging. For the last 3 months, I have been building DeFiNet full time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f646" name="f646">For both, I keep hearing about how important the story is. The difference is that for one, I am trying to tell a story. For the other, I am trying to create a system that generates revenue.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d331" name="d331">I like doing both. Sometimes I like one more than the other and that preference shifts back and forth daily. But there are also a lot of companies whose founders don’t have that same desire to create content. They want to focus on building the revenue generation system.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3d96" name="3d96">What do startup founders currently do? Sometimes they try to keep a company blog going. Or be present on social media. Or hire people if they can. But what if you don’t want to be on social media and you don’t want to write a blog? What if you can’t afford to pay someone?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="340c" name="340c">I think DeFiNet might be able to help. Because I think there is a lot of value that isn’t being captured here. Look for an upcoming post in which I break down some of my ideas. I listened to a great podcast today that highlighted some pain points that we are working on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3d78" name="3d78">Right now, I need to validate some basic principles that I am building on.</p><ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="0773" name="0773">I think the insight of a startup founder is valuable. I am taking an insane amount of risk. There is a reason why.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="dd63" name="dd63">I need to experiment. A lot. If I can build an audience with paid subscriptions, I don’t have to charge for experimental products as I build everything out.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="0ad7" name="0ad7">The more subscribers I have, the faster I can experiment. The toughest part of working on a super tight budget is that I have to build out the pieces myself. I would love to pay a team to really start building faster.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="a06b" name="a06b">I want to spend more time writing. I have a ton of things I want to share. I love the idea of building in public. I want to spend more time doing that for a number of reasons that I will share in the future. What if building in public were a suitable funding source? I think it could be.</li></ol><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="0a73" name="0a73">One thing I haven’t managed to do yet: I haven’t been able to separate the content from the products I am trying to build. This just makes everything confusing. And my conversion rate sucks. I am trying to sell future products as content now and that doesn’t work. Or rather, it hasn’t been working for me.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="88aa" name="88aa">But what if the content was the product?</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="2e28" name="2e28">This is how it looks in my head. There will some adjustments as I get feedback. Please feel free to reply if you have any.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1227" name="1227">I will talk about the “what” we are doing in our public posts. But the member posts will detail the “why”.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9987" name="9987">Because the why is where I think the true value lies. Anybody could put the pieces together in the same way I have. But only I know exactly why I made the decisions I did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ba85" name="ba85">And here is the cool thing. If you pay me $5/month, you have just bought the right to ask me why I made any decision I did. Or rather, you have bought the answer to your question. I will answer you individually and write a blog about it (at some point, at least. Not as immediately as your answer, probably).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="117f" name="117f">One of the things I believe in deeply is data-driven decision-making. This typically allows me to pretty easily answer the why. The answer is not always right, but it is always my answer based on the data I had.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9aff" name="9aff">Let’s see if we can do this. Let me know if you think that’s worth $5. In time, I will prove to you that it is worth so much more than that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9805" name="9805">I am going to make DeFiNet the first story-driven company.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea20" name="ea20">When talking to investors, they always want to hear your story. When selling, you sell your story. You have to know your story anyway.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="e274" name="e274">Why not use it to fund your business?</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="86cc" name="86cc">I think that the time has come for a new business model.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c6a6" name="c6a6">Because I think that by sharing the story, Hugs can reach more people like Karen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7257" name="7257">Technology and emotion are more closely linked than we usually understand. Hugs tries to find those links in a different way. So does DeFiNet.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e387" name="e387">Help us support Hugs and similar projects.
