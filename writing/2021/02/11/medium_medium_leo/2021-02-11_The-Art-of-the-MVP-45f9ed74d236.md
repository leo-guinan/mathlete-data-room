But one thing stands out to me. I didn’t understand the concept of MVP as well as I thought I did and that resulted in a lot of lost time during which I could have been selling.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="bf21" name="bf21">Who Are You Building For?</h4><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4" id="4b32" name="4b32"><img class="graf-image" data-height="3000" data-image-id="0*S6v5LQnT1KJHk5m2" data-unsplash-photo-id="J2jJdmb04HU" data-width="2000" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*S6v5LQnT1KJHk5m2"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@patrickperkins?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com/@patrickperkins?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Patrick Perkins</a> on <a class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="b05b" name="b05b">Before you answer, think carefully.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84f5" name="84f5">I tried a number of things as my MVP. I kept revolving around some central ideas but wasn’t able to really settle on anything that worked. I kept analyzing it to try to figure out what the problem was.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="52e1" name="52e1">Turns out, I was trying to build for two different audiences. On one hand, I wanted to build something that I could sell to start pulling in revenue. I quit my job rather suddenly to launch this and time was quickly running out on my savings. So how can I build something that makes money?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7a32" name="7a32">But on the other, I was trying to build with an eye on VC funding. So I wanted something that I thought represented the future I was trying to build.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9a00" name="9a00">In the end, I missed the mark on both. I created something that nobody wanted to pay for and also something that no VC was able to easily see the vision for.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3c6d" name="3c6d">I re-evaluated. I talked to people. The one thing I did right was that I kept getting what I thought of as an MVP in front of people that I thought would pay for it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5e6e" name="5e6e">In doing so, I screwed something else up as well. I let feedback fracture my focus on what I was trying to build. I started trying to build out a SaaS offering. It was suggested to me that it might be something people would pay for. I got some decent feedback on it and I might have been able to make it work. I still plan on building it into other parts of things that I am building. But it was going to take more development time than I wanted to spend. And it didn’t do a great job representing what I wanted my company to be.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6fad" name="6fad">Great. So at this point, I have been working for 3 months with no pay. My savings are exhausted and I have a total of $10 in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). I did manage to make a single sale.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ad8f" name="ad8f">What Now?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1dc4" name="1dc4">I stopped and re-evaluated. I focused on who my target audience was. I simplified my idea to its most basic principles. And I launched a site based on those principles.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7644" name="7644">I may not have done a great job selling my ideas in the first 3 months of launching my startup. But I have learned a ton. And that knowledge will be my saving grace.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a7b3" name="a7b3">This is now my idea. What if everyone had an instant MVP that they could easily monetize? Everybody who starts a company has one thing in common.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96e2" name="96e2">They have a story. There is a reason that they are building the company they are. There is something that they see as an opportunity that others do not.</p><blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" id="b3f7" name="b3f7">What if your story could be your MVP?</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" id="55a6" name="55a6">Only time will tell.
