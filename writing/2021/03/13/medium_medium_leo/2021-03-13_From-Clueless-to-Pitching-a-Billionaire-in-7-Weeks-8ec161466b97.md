My startup has made $20 in the two months of existence. If you look at the numbers, you would never invest in my business. I quit my job in November. November 5th, 2020, to be exact. As I write this, it is March 11, 2021. Over four months of trying to get things figured out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="90a6" name="90a6">In that time, I have worked on my content creation. I have built a blog and started editing the first episode of my startup’s podcast. I launched a paid Substack newsletter. I have a single paid subscriber and a handful of gift subscribers. I am not successful by any financial metric. If you count the cost of incorporating my company, I am very much in the negative.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="21e9" name="21e9">But today, I got to pitch my company to Tim in a small Zoom call. I was one of 20 finalists in the GSV Startup Bootcamp pitch competition. There were over 80 companies that pitched yesterday, and 20 companies made the cut and got to pitch today. The goal: a chance to pitch on Meet the Drapers. That’s Tim’s show.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="399b" name="399b"><iframe frameborder="0" height="393" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/izeF2VZ_BkU?feature=oembed" width="700"></iframe></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="e9ce" name="e9ce">Think Shark Tank + Chopped for startups. I hadn’t seen the show prior to today. I didn’t think I would even be one of the finalists. I knew that it was technically a possibility, but again. Have you seen my numbers?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7242" name="7242">I don’t think I got selected for the show. I let my nerves get the better of me. I didn’t expect Tim to be on the call. I thought we were pitching to some of his representatives but didn’t think he would show up on the call himself. It shouldn’t have mattered. But it did. It got in my head. I delivered my pitch but I don’t think I did so particularly well. I felt a lot shakier than I did yesterday.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1a48" name="1a48">Again, it shouldn’t have mattered. But it did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0a23" name="0a23">Always be ready to pitch. You never know who will be on a call with you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a478" name="a478">I wasn’t one of the few companies that Tim personally requested a follow-up with. There will be a longer list released, but I was in a group of incredible companies. I still can’t believe I was in that group.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8d0d" name="8d0d">That was the best part of the bootcamp. I got to work with some incredible people who are building some incredible companies. I worked with people who have been starting companies for decades and some who were starting their first (like me!). We got access to super high-quality advisors as we worked through the content they put together. There is no way this program should be free. But it was.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d14e" name="d14e">The one major takeaway for me was a shift in my mindset. I always thought that I needed a killer idea to launch a company. I was always on the lookout for the can’t miss product idea. Then I finally thought I had one.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0fe0" name="0fe0">Turns out, I never needed a killer product idea. If you are looking, products are everywhere. You just need to have an entrepreneurial mindset. You have to know how to help people solve problems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="082a" name="082a">I thought I needed to know all about how businesses work to start charging people. I needed to have all the parts worked out. I needed to engineer the perfect solution.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0ea7" name="0ea7">You don’t need to do that. You figure out where you have the most value and you help people in that space solve problems. It doesn’t matter whether you are a writer, a small-business owner, or a startup founder. The main goal is to help people solve some problem or provide some entertainment. Bonus points if you do both! The money will come if you can do that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="060d" name="060d">I focused too much on the money part of the problem. The problem is that I don’t have the proof there. So how can I sell that?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="83bc" name="83bc">Answer: you don’t. You figure out what value you can provide by providing value to others. Then you package that up and sell it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ec60" name="ec60">I didn’t think I had value by myself. I kept trying to sell people on my idea. That’s not how you start a business. Again, you solve problems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c16e" name="c16e">That’s what I figured out as I finished bootcamp.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb9a" name="fb9a">Understanding that helped me nail my pitch yesterday. It got me in the room with the billionaire.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3a96" name="3a96">And if I can get in that room with less than $100 of revenue? Then imagine what I can do when I actually have a product and revenue.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2fbf" name="2fbf">It’s all about the mindset.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="b06f"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="74b1" name="74b1"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://personal.guinantech.com/journey" href="https://personal.guinantech.com/journey" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Want to follow my startup journey?
