I had recently spoken with my dream investor. It had taken almost three months to get a conversation with him, but it sounded like he was interested. I was broke. I had given everything to get my company off the ground.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9651" name="9651">I hatched a plan. I had recently discovered some new technology that should make it easy to launch my platform. I had been building my company in public. I decided to do a 24-hour hackathon in which I would launch my new platform. I needed some money quickly, so I had the bright idea of using my hackathon as a way to make some money. I was live-tweeting my progress as I attempted to solicit donations. I emailed my dream investor to let him in on the plan.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="c9c9" name="c9c9">The Hackathon</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="2317" name="2317">The day came. I was ready. I started furiously working. Then I started having problems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e78e" name="e78e">I’d screwed up. I thought I had a template I could easily build from. And in all honesty, I probably could have if I had spent the time beforehand getting fully up to speed on the layout of the repo and the underlying technology. It was something I had used before and my arrogance blinded me to the fact that I was out of practice. Couple that with trying to figure out the new tech stack that I thought was so easy? A recipe for failure.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2b6c" name="2b6c">By the end of the hackathon, I had raised a whopping $20, I didn’t have a working site, and I was in a bad place. I had planned on a number of possible successful outcomes. I didn’t consider the fact that I would completely fail.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c7d6" name="c7d6">But fail I did.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ac58" name="ac58">The Fallout</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1415" name="1415">Where did that leave me?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e427" name="e427">I want to say that it left me right where I started. It certainly didn’t feel like I had gone anywhere. It actually felt like, if anything, I had gone backward.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2592" name="2592">Upon reflection, that’s not the case.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cdff" name="cdff">Did I secure my dream investor? No. In fact, I haven’t heard from him since our one call. I don’t know if I misinterpreted his interest in my business (wouldn’t be the first time) or if this colossal public failure made him not want to take a chance on me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0316" name="0316">Did I have a product I could actually sell? Also, no. I thought I figured out how to build a product. Turns out, I was focused on the wrong thing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="870b" name="870b">A funny thing happened. The sun came up the next day.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="acc2" name="acc2">The world didn’t end because I failed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="95f2" name="95f2">I didn’t lose my audience. In fact, my level of engagement with my audience went up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1c0c" name="1c0c">I ended up figuring out my personal finances enough to buy me a little more time to get my company up and running.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8b2c" name="8b2c">As it happens, pinning your entire financial future on one day might not be the recipe for success that I thought it would be.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67a4" name="67a4">When I was able to reduce the level of financial strain I was under, it became pretty clear why I failed. I focused too much on the money. I was desperate and it was pretty obvious. Analyzing my failure gave me a ton of insight into why I had failed. It let me stop, take a deep breath, and adjust my course.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bb27" name="bb27">Failure cost me nothing and taught me a ton.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6c5e" name="6c5e">And I am continuing to build in public. As part of this, I have gotten a chance to meet some very cool people who are doing the same. Today I discovered Ben Putano, who is writing his book in public. I took the opportunity to read the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://greatfounderswrite.substack.com/p/ready-for-feedback-chapter-1-of-great" href="https://greatfounderswrite.substack.com/p/ready-for-feedback-chapter-1-of-great" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first chapter</a> that he had put out into the world. Ben is my inspiration for this post. The connections of writing, founders, and building in public really resonated with me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c6e6" name="c6e6">It is tough to put yourself out there.

I have spent a good deal of the last 10 years avoiding being vulnerable. I have <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd#:~:text=Attention%20deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder%20(ADHD,and%20children%20can%20have%20ADHD." href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd#:~:text=Attention%20deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder%20%28ADHD,and%20children%20can%20have%20ADHD." rel="noopener" target="_blank">ADHD</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ASD</a>. For those not familiar, one of the common symptoms of ADHD is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://blackgirllostkeys.com/adhd/adhd-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria/" href="https://blackgirllostkeys.com/adhd/adhd-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria</a>. In a nutshell, any time I get even a hint of rejection, it cuts deep. I was diagnosed fairly recently, so I am still learning how this has shaped my life.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a3d5" name="a3d5">When you aren’t aware of it, it seems to come out of nowhere. Somebody makes a comment and all of a sudden, you get hit with such a wave of emotion that you can’t function. Over time, I learned that the best way to avoid the pain was to build a shell around myself and avoid being remotely vulnerable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ebdf" name="ebdf">After I was diagnosed, I started to learn more about where it had impacted my life. The biggest impact that I noticed was that I had an extremely hard time opening up to people. To combat this, I force myself to be open with others, even knowing that I can (and likely will) be hurt in the process.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="22e8" name="22e8">I’m still not great at it. Building in public is still a bit of a struggle for me. I have been trying to be a little more open each day. By doing so, I have made connections with some incredible people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ca68" name="ca68">And I have been hurt. Some days, I feel completely overwhelmed. When I failed in my hackathon and I thought my family’s finances were completely screwed, I got hit hard.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8729" name="8729">Then the sun came up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="09f7" name="09f7">Is it hard to be vulnerable? Definitely.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5973" name="5973">A funny thing happens when you are though. You open yourself up to a world of possibilities that didn’t exist previously.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7d4d" name="7d4d">Don’t believe me?
