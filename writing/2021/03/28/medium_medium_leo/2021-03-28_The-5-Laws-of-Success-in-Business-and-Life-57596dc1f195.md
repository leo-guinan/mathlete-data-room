Coming from an engineering background, I knew my experience on the business side of things was lacking.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fa6c" name="fa6c">This has been confirmed by the distinct lack of monetary success thus far. But I have been learning. One of the things I did was that I took advantage of an offer to receive free coaching. Through a networking event, I was offered the chance to be part of a coaching group for executives. Even though I didn’t quite meet the specified criteria, I thought that it might be a hugely beneficial experience. I had no idea. Two weeks into the program, I learned the secrets of business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5cc5" name="5cc5">We were given a book called “The Go-Giver” by Bob Burg and John David Mann. It was a quick read, but possibly one of the most valuable of my life. It is a story that revolves around these 5 Laws of Business. I have had the luck of being in conversations lately with some very successful people. These laws are in full effect. I encourage you to follow these laws in your own life and see where it takes you.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="dd5c" name="dd5c">The Five Laws of Stratospheric Success</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="6f69" name="6f69">Law 1: The Law of Value</h4><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4" id="b8f0" name="b8f0">Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="aa5a" name="aa5a">This part has been difficult for me. I thought I understood the concept of value and how it related to payments. I thought that I could provide some value and people would naturally understand exactly how valuable my offering could be.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="61e4" name="61e4">The truth is that people aren’t great at understanding the value you provide. But that’s ok. Just provide the maximum value you can while taking the minimum payment you can. It seems counterintuitive, but when dealing with humans, the correct answer is almost never to maximize profits.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="26dd" name="26dd">One thing that I learned when I went from corporate life to launching a startup. Corporate America doesn’t want you to know how much you are worth. Because in most cases, they aren’t paying you enough. But one thing they do is provide you that safety net, which makes it a scary thing to leave. Insurance, sick time, payroll. They give you a sense of safety. That they can yank out from under you at any point. Realize that all of that goes into the value you can provide. That’s why side hustles are so attractive. You get the safety net and the higher earnings potential.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="0493" name="0493">Law 2: The Law of Compensation</h4><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4" id="967d" name="967d">Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="73e8" name="73e8">This was an interesting revelation to me. Why are tech salaries so inflated? Because tech gives people the ability to serve people in much larger numbers. It gives anybody who can code the ability to affect the lives of millions of people. With the rise of no-code platforms and the creator economy, people outside of tech are seeing how to take advantage of this law.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6eaa" name="6eaa">If you want to get rich, figure out how to solve the problems that lots of people have. Technology allows us to do things that scale. Why did Zuckerberg make so much money? He gave everyone a home on the internet. Whatever your thoughts on Facebook (I certainly have a few), this provided a ton of value to its users. That’s why Facebook stays entrenched. People are locked in. It’s their internet home and the cost/effort to switch is too great to overcome.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e69a" name="e69a"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/how-to-know-you-didnt-do-a-good-job-explaining-your-startup-13bc8006abb0" href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/how-to-know-you-didnt-do-a-good-job-explaining-your-startup-13bc8006abb0" target="_blank">Maybe you can just get everyone on Facebook to pay you a dollar</a>.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="632b" name="632b">Law 3: The Law of Influence</h4><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4" id="8326" name="8326">Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people’s interests first.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="7c02" name="7c02">As a creator, one of the hardest problems is distribution. If you self-promote everywhere, you usually don’t build trust. You get ignored. You don’t have much influence when you are getting ignored. How can you change that? By sharing other content. By collaborating with other creators. It isn’t all about yourself. It is also a lot easier when you don’t have to rely only on yourself. I am focusing on ways that I can bring others into the spotlight.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ab19" name="ab19">While forming my company the approach was simple. Prove that we could help creators distribute their content. The initial attempt was to distribute our own content. That didn’t work because we didn’t have the influence for people to automatically care what we wrote about.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="94b8" name="94b8">The second attempt was getting users to sign up and submit their own links. That got a little bit more traction but wasn’t easily sustainable. Then we decided to focus on just sharing content we found valuable. That’s when we started to gain traction. We had to come in providing value.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c8ec" name="c8ec">Instead of worrying about getting entries in my database, I started making a concerted effort to share others’ articles. I was actively working to get their voices out and that gave me more authority in their eyes. I needed to focus less on the data to prove my ideas. My users needed to feel that I was there to help them. My influence started growing.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a1a7" name="a1a7">Law 4: The Law of Authenticity</h4><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4" id="e804" name="e804">The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="e35e" name="e35e">This is why I started writing. My writing is as much to help me figure out who I am as it is for you. Writing helps me understand my own life and I hope that my reflections help you as well. If I try to write like someone I am not, it goes badly. I like to keep my writing rawer and with less polish because of this. I don’t want to edit my authenticity out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aab0" name="aab0">Authenticity is perhaps the most important part to me. As someone with ADHD and ASD, one of the things I have gotten used to is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking" rel="noopener" target="_blank">masking</a>. When you get used to masking, you can lose yourself. I came close. But writing is helping me find myself again. And being authentically myself has helped me connect with my audience.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="59c3" name="59c3">Law 5: The Law of Receptivity</h4><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4" id="4a99" name="4a99">The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="0019" name="0019">This is another part I struggled with. Mostly, I thought I was struggling with the idea of accepting money. I have been working on ways to figure out the best ways I can set that up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="b635" name="b635">At one point, I broke down and asked my social media followers for donations as I attempted to live-tweet a personal hackathon. It got me a few bucks, but nothing major. I wasn’t being as receptive as I should have been to feedback. I thought I was doing ok, but upon reflection, I realized I had missed a few opportunities because I was too focused on money. Had I not been trying to find money, I could have possibly opened up some doors. But mistakes were made. All I can do is learn from them and be more open to receiving ideas and connections even if what I think I need is money.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body" name="069f"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading" id="49c2" name="49c2">Final Thoughts</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e5c8" name="e5c8">I hope that helps you. It opened my eyes to the way the world works at the highest levels. Social media tends to show the world working the opposite way. Everybody is out for their own benefit. It trains you to be the same way.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2429" name="2429">To recap:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="4e82" name="4e82">Law 1: <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Law of Value</strong>: Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="303a" name="303a">Law 2: <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Law of Compensation</strong>: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="20e7" name="20e7">Law 3: <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Law of Influence</strong>: Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people’s interests first.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="334e" name="334e">Law 4: <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Law of Authenticity</strong>: The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="b8e6" name="b8e6">Law 5: <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Law of Receptivity</strong>: The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="63b0" name="63b0">To end with one of the most poignant quotes from the book:</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c450" name="c450">“In fact, most people laugh when they hear that the secret to success is <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">giving</em>.” He paused. “Then again, most people are nowhere near as successful as they wish they were.”</blockquote></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="fb79"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="57da" name="57da"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://thegogiver.com/" href="https://thegogiver.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find out more about “The Go-Giver” here.</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="fe4c" name="fe4c"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://personal.guinantech.com/subscribe" href="https://personal.guinantech.com/subscribe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sign up for my mailing list here to be notified when I learn more lessons in life.</a></p></div></div></section>
