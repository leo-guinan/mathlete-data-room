And then I am going to continue with a bit more probably. This prompt came at an interesting time for me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="02c6" name="02c6">Right now, my customer is going over their writing goals for the coming month. They have a target income they will try to hit. They try to plan their schedule to match their income needs for the month. Then they discover DeFiNet. They join a collaboration. This reduces the pressure on them to pump out content in order to be successful. They are better able to deal with the unexpected.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="10bc" name="10bc">Ok, that hits the prompt specifically. But now I want to talk about something else. I want to talk about how a customer impacted me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fa40" name="fa40">I’ve been trying to make Medium a more collaborative place when it comes to making money. I’ve been reaching out to pretty much anyone I can. But I’ve been focused on the data portion. How do we help each other in terms of making money in relation to things like SEO?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e81b" name="e81b">One of the ideas I have been kicking around is the idea of writing summaries for other writers’ work. Imagine the snippets that you see on a Google search result page, but written by other writers. I invited the first couple of members of the community to summarize one of my articles and I summarized theirs. I’ve been planning on doing more this coming week. I wanted to analyze the performance of these summaries in comparison to the main article.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="795e" name="795e">Today, I got the first summary of my article and I was floored. It wasn’t what I was expecting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d1ad" name="d1ad">It was so much more than I was hoping for. <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="227ff1d8e49a" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/u/227ff1d8e49a" data-user-id="227ff1d8e49a" href="https://medium.com/u/227ff1d8e49a" target="_blank">K. Barrett</a> showed me how my writing touched her life. It came at a good time for me. I was starting to wonder if I was going to be able to make it all work. I’ve started to see some progress trending in the right direction, but I didn’t think I could make it all work fast enough.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5a5" name="e5a5">But after I read this, I realized that if I changed my perspective on the problem, a solution could be reached faster. I could change my mindset.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="31ef" name="31ef">In the prompt, I refer to what I view as a long-term success. The problem is the long-term part. I plan on using data over time to prove my hypothesis, which works unless you need a product now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6d22" name="6d22">How can I help the writer now?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9cda" name="9cda">What if I approached the problem from the view of the publication? Suddenly, a number of potential products appeared, all with a much shorter time to market. I had gotten into a fixed mindset and didn’t let myself see the whole picture. I changed my mindset, viewed the problem from a different angle, and noticed a solution.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c516" name="c516">Sometimes the best results are the most unexpected.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="08e0" name="08e0">Check it out for yourself:</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="41f5" name="41f5"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://vantagepointsforawe.medium.com/discovered-from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-337de33711fb" href="https://vantagepointsforawe.medium.com/discovered-from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-337de33711fb" title="https://vantagepointsforawe.medium.com/discovered-from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-337de33711fb"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Discovered: From Clueless to Pitching a Billionaire in 7 Weeks</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">A story about mindset and taking the first steps by Leo Guinan</em>vantagepointsforawe.medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="4fff5d55552693d6250c0211b84b6e68" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*YqWoBdrbdrH3_cA7JerP7Q.png" href="https://vantagepointsforawe.medium.com/discovered-from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-337de33711fb" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*YqWoBdrbdrH3_cA7JerP7Q.png);"></a></div><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing" id="e5b9" name="e5b9">Thanks <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="227ff1d8e49a" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/u/227ff1d8e49a" data-user-id="227ff1d8e49a" href="https://medium.com/u/227ff1d8e49a" target="_blank">K.
