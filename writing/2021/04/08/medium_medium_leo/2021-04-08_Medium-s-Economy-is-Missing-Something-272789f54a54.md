I haven’t been seeing the results I’ve wanted. I was battling the whole chicken and egg problem. The ideas I had were focused on the future, where I was being guided by user data and feedback on what the specific features would be. The problem is that I don’t have that data until I have users. And it is hard to get users without a product.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7d7d" name="7d7d">There was something missing in my conversations. There was a communication barrier somewhere. Something wasn’t clicking with other people like I wanted it to.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="55b5" name="55b5">Then I was talking to my co-founder, <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="d490d66ddbf3" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/u/d490d66ddbf3" data-user-id="d490d66ddbf3" href="https://medium.com/u/d490d66ddbf3" target="_blank">Parikshit Bhanushali</a>. I was trying to explain how my idea worked and he wasn’t seeing it the same way I was. He asked me to draw some diagrams that would help him understand. As I started doing this, I saw where Medium connected and I got it. Nobody else that I was talking to understood the Medium economy quite as I do.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a2fe" name="a2fe">So I wanted to write a bit about how I see the Medium economy and why I think it is a perfect fit for building DeFiNet’s first product.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="3d2c" name="3d2c">How Medium Pays Writers</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="248f" name="248f">Medium has an interesting pay structure. They charge users $5/month to read unlimited articles. That $5 is split between the authors of the blogs that the user reads over that month.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6a1e" name="6a1e">How does Medium determine who gets what part of that $5? By splitting it up according to the amount of time the user spent reading each article. If the user spent 20% of their reading time on Writer A’s blogs, 30% on Writer B’s blogs, and 50% on Writer C’s blogs, Writer A would make $1, Writer B would make $1.50, and Writer C would make $2.50.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="01ad" name="01ad">I assume that Medium also takes a percentage of the membership, but to make the math easier, I excluded it from the example.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6890" name="6890">This is a very pure structure. It is hard to game that system. Medium started by trying to pay writers based on metrics like claps, but those are easily gamed. Read time is a lot harder. It also gives the writer a lot of axes on which they can experiment to see which variables impact their earnings. Next, let's examine the metrics that writers are given to understand how their articles make money.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="bc51" name="bc51">Understand the Performance of Your Articles</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="0f8c" name="0f8c">One of the biggest complaints that I have seen about Medium is the lack of advanced stats. Honestly, the stats page does lack a bit and I have some plans for improving that. My problem is that I don’t have enough data. Since I am the only writer whose stats I can see, I’m limited in understanding how each part performs. I have to write a bunch of different articles and look at which ones were the most successful. Then I can figure out what I should write more about.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7dda" name="7dda">I don’t think this is how most writers approach their craft. I was reading <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="b6d641be1066" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/u/b6d641be1066" data-user-id="b6d641be1066" href="https://medium.com/u/b6d641be1066" target="_blank">Tim Denning</a> today, and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://writingcooperative.com/you-need-real-time-data-to-significantly-increase-the-attraction-of-your-content-cc5cb2006027" href="https://writingcooperative.com/you-need-real-time-data-to-significantly-increase-the-attraction-of-your-content-cc5cb2006027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he had a post that spoke to the need for real-time data.</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dbae" name="dbae">This is the quote that spoke to me:</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="76de" name="76de">“You become an even better writer with data-backed insights to inspire and loosely guide you.” ~ Tim Denning</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="c509" name="c509">This opened up the second part of understanding how your articles perform. You need someplace where there is an audience that you can drop your article and check its performance. Twitter and LinkedIn are great places to do that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7dff" name="7dff">Unless your Twitter/LinkedIn audience isn’t where your Medium audience is found. That makes it different. Then you have to figure out where your target audience is on those platforms and figure out how to reach them on those platforms. You can spend a long time analyzing how these platforms work. I’ve done it. There’s still a lot of trial and error.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="9c7f" name="9c7f">The Role of Publications</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="2947" name="2947">This is where publications come into play at Medium. The top publications have the audiences. They’ve figured out what content a certain type of audience likes and spends a lot of time and resources editing articles from writers who submit to them. They provide curated content that meets a certain standard. At some of the publications, that standard is very high and a small percentage of submissions are accepted. At others, all submissions are accepted. Different publications have their own rules and new ones are constantly coming and going.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2e06" name="2e06">This has been the biggest pain point for me. I started out trying to find a ton of different publications and see which ones performed better. I ended up settling into a couple that I knew would publish my articles. I would usually submit to Start It Up, get rejected, and then submit to one of the ones I knew would accept me. It was more important to me to just write and publish.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ca30" name="ca30">How did that work for me? Most of my articles have fewer than 50 views. I expected that though, so not worried. One of the main things I was doing was practicing and building up a body of work. I got to experiment freely with various pieces such as CTAs and landing pages. Then things started to work a little better.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0149" name="0149">I started getting accepted to Start It Up. I had a couple of articles accepted and they each got 100s of views instead of 10s. I credit this to a couple of factors.</p><ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="8298" name="8298">Start It Up is one of the best-known publications and is followed by lots of people. My articles are being more widely circulated to their subscribers. I was also featured on their page, which seems to have benefitted me.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="80d4" name="80d4">Their editor gave me some great feedback on one of my articles in particular. It’s now one of my best-performing articles.</li></ol><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="72d1" name="72d1">Publications exist for one main reason. To collect stories fitting some criteria (quality, topic, etc.). Many also have distribution mechanisms such as email lists and social media accounts. These all play a role in helping an article get the most views possible. Editors run these publications and make the decision as to what makes the cut and what doesn’t.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1fb0" name="1fb0">The problem that I see with this model is that the publications aren’t sustainable entities. Where are they in the payment model? They are such an integral part of the process, so why aren’t they represented?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f395" name="f395">I think the answer is that Medium doesn’t really want them. But they are also kinda necessary. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81" href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81" rel="noopener" target="_blank">They tried running their own large publications, which didn’t work out.</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9fa5" name="9fa5"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://ev.medium.com/toward-a-more-relational-medium-e801ff4653a4" href="https://ev.medium.com/toward-a-more-relational-medium-e801ff4653a4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">They want a more relational model</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5c6" name="e5c6">The editors at publications end up acting like gatekeepers. I’ve heard of cases where editors receive abuse for rejecting articles. The editors are pitted against the writers. That doesn’t make sense to me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c0e1" name="c0e1">I think we should do the opposite. I think we should foster a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. That’s where true success lies. To me, that is a big use for NFTs. Let’s align the editors and writers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a966" name="a966">What if you could give your editor 20% of your article's earnings in exchange for the editing work and getting into the optimal publication? What if publications were simply categorizations to allow you to reach the optimal fan base and not a competitive one where editors act as referees? Stay tuned. I’ll be writing more on this topic soon.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="f648" name="f648">Individual Article Performance</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="42ba" name="42ba">Without a ton of views, I have to watch how I analyze my articles. I had the problem of going viral early, which completely throws off my cumulative stats. Hard to read when 90% of your views are the result of one article. (Ok, had to look it up. That one article accounted for 179K views. Overall, I have just shy of 207K views. So actually about 86.5% of my views)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ed29" name="ed29">So what do I look for? Medium provides the following stats:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="1a26" name="1a26">Views — How many people clicked on this article?</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="0fb1" name="0fb1">Reads — Of the people who clicked on the article, how many people spent long enough on it to read it (still don’t know exactly how they calculate this, but that should be a good enough approximation)</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="b912" name="b912">Read Ratio — Reads / Views as a percentage</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="13f6" name="13f6">Fans — How many different people clapped for your story?</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="0200" name="0200">Claps — How many claps did your story receive (max 50 claps/user/story)</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="01ef" name="01ef">Average Read Time — How long did users average on the story?</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="dea7" name="dea7">Lifetime Member Reading Time — this is the number that directly affects your earnings. How long have members spent reading your article? You don’t know exactly how much each member’s view is worth to your article so you want to maximize this to maximize earnings.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="fd64" name="fd64">Earnings — How much money has this story earned?</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="7665" name="7665">Views By Traffic Source — Where is the traffic coming from? Inside of Medium or from other sources? Are they external views (not counted toward earnings) or internal views (counted for earnings)?</li></ul><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li" id="e26f" name="e26f">What do I look for in each article?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f6a5" name="f6a5">I personally like to look at two things. I care about the Read Ratio and the Views By Traffic Source. This tells me how many people stick around for the whole article. I’ve seen some writers claim that 40–50% is pretty good. I’ve been hitting 60–80% consistently, but as I said, I also get fewer views. A fair number of those views are likely from writing groups I belong to and share my work in. Just now getting into the hundreds, I’ve seen a bit of fluctuation so I am curious to see if that continues as I start to grow my audience more.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="28ff" name="28ff">But why Views By Traffic Source? This has actually been an enlightening metric for me. For example, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/definet/what-i-learned-about-the-future-by-watching-sea-shanty-tiktok-collaborations-2d5ab6c9bdc7" href="https://medium.com/definet/what-i-learned-about-the-future-by-watching-sea-shanty-tiktok-collaborations-2d5ab6c9bdc7" target="_blank">I once wrote about discovering Tik Tok due to figuring out they have sea shanties on there</a>. Turned out, I was early on that trend so I all of a sudden got a bunch of views from Google that I didn’t expect. Realized that if you searched for “Tik Tok Sea Shanties”, my picture came up as did my article. That led to some insights that I will cover in a future article.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a677" name="a677">I’ve been watching those while I worked to get good enough to get into Start It Up. That way, once I did, I would hopefully have more people trickling into each of the other articles.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1d45" name="1d45">Let’s take a look at the stats for my first NFT:</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="097a" name="097a"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/definet/nfts-for-medium-730660a7c019" href="https://medium.com/definet/nfts-for-medium-730660a7c019" title="https://medium.com/definet/nfts-for-medium-730660a7c019"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">NFTs For Medium</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Let’s Model It Like The Soccer Transfer Market</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="b68b33862eb453d47a2440dd1b337eec" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*EyrDDFy-H4W9oDpy" href="https://medium.com/definet/nfts-for-medium-730660a7c019" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*EyrDDFy-H4W9oDpy);"></a></div><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="4463" name="4463">Views: 41<br/>Internal Views: 10<br/>External Views: 31</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="7557" name="7557">Reads: 25</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="ea85" name="ea85">Read Ratio: 61%</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="e808" name="e808">Fans: 1</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="bd1a" name="bd1a">Claps: 25</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="c2c1" name="c2c1">Earnings (through April 7th): $0.13</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="8413" name="8413">Average Reading Time: 2 Minutes 57 Seconds</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="004c" name="004c">Lifetime Member Reading Time: 4 Minutes 40 Seconds</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="c47b" name="c47b">For comparison, here is my best performing article that I got published in Start It Up (published March 13th)</p><div class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p" id="86c3" name="86c3"><a class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/swlh/from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-8ec161466b97" href="https://medium.com/swlh/from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-8ec161466b97" title="https://medium.com/swlh/from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-8ec161466b97"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">From Clueless to Pitching a Billionaire in 7 Weeks</strong><br/><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The importance of shifting your mindset</em>medium.com</a><a class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="7f9296eb76a838183deba3ad31cc5155" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*8GyE83y9k36AbCmq" href="https://medium.com/swlh/from-clueless-to-pitching-a-billionaire-in-7-weeks-8ec161466b97" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*8GyE83y9k36AbCmq);"></a></div><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--mixtapeEmbed" id="a3f0" name="a3f0">Views: 702<br/>Internal Views: 555<br/>External Views: 147</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="47e6" name="47e6">Reads: 375</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="4f61" name="4f61">Read Ratio: 53%</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="5ad7" name="5ad7">Fans: 22</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="32f5" name="32f5">Claps: 307</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="879b" name="879b">Earnings (through April 7th): $26.38</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="7590" name="7590">Average Reading Time: 2 Minutes 11 Seconds</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="5b4f" name="5b4f">Lifetime Member Reading Time: 7 Hours 31 Minutes</li></ul><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li" id="c1c5" name="c1c5">Let’s Play A Game</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="b429" name="b429">Why am I giving you those stats?
