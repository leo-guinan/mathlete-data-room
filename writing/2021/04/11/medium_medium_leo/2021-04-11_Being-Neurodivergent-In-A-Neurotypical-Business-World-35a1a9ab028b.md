I was in my first position out of college. I had been there for a few months now and I was starting to figure things out. I was enjoying having a dual-screen setup for the first time. One of the things I had figured out in my extended undergraduate journey was that watching movies while I worked helped me keep focus. So I started throwing up movies on one screen and programming on the other. Then I got called into this meeting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="2efc" name="2efc">“Leo, we can’t have you watching movies while you work. Other people have noticed and said a few things.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9681" name="9681">I nervously agreed and went back to my desk. Guess I would figure something else out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c6c8" name="c6c8">Fast-forward a few months later. I was getting my performance review.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="12c9" name="12c9">“Hey Leo. You’ve done extremely well so far. But one thing I keep hearing is that you need to slow down. You’re getting more code review comments than the other developers.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cfb7" name="cfb7">I agreed that I was, because I was pushing code at a much faster rate. Yes, I may have been getting 3 times as many code review comments, but it was because I was opening up 3 times as many pull requests.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="ffad" name="ffad">“You need to slow down.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9897" name="9897">It was like this for the next few years. I would get comments like this that I kept trying to understand. They didn’t make sense to me. I started getting treatment for anxiety, depression, and sleep issues.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ba92" name="ba92">I kept trying to mold myself to be this person that corporate America really wanted me to be. That’s the path to success right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="10d6" name="10d6">I kept getting passed over for promotions for things like this. They kept telling me I wasn’t ready yet. I hadn’t put in the time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a615" name="a615">I ended up switching jobs a couple of times over the next 10 years, but I kept experiencing the same. I continued to get feedback that didn’t make a ton of sense to me. There were three themes: “What would other people think?”, “You need to slow down.”, “You haven’t put in the time”.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="397e" name="397e">I just kept producing more and more. I started working on side projects for work that kept getting integrated into our workflows. Everyone was really appreciative. But I wouldn’t advance because of those three points above.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="49dd" name="49dd">Then I realized I had ADHD. And everything became clear.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2b6b" name="2b6b">One thing I didn’t realize at the time was that I was spending so much of my energy at work, trying to fit into these places that didn’t appreciate who I was, that I just didn’t have the energy to deal with people outside of work. Most of my life became me going to work, coming home and spending the evening with my family, and crashing into bed, only to do the same the next day.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4b42" name="4b42">Then the pandemic hit. All of a sudden, I was able to structure my workday in a manner that would make me productive. And I was! I was actually so much more efficient that it seemed like I found an extra 8 hours each day. My output was fantastic. I applied for a job as a Tech Lead at my company. Once again, I got rejected. I didn’t have the experience that the manager was looking for. I have a decade of experience as a software engineer, a Master’s of Science in Software Engineering, a BS in Computer Science, and a stint as a lead in a former role. I was also a lead on my team in all but name.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e2cc" name="e2cc">And then I started writing. Shit got a bit weird for me. I figured out how to go viral about a month into my writing. I pissed a lot of people off. I attracted a lot of hate for it. Not my finest moment. I dropped all of my social media and stuck to writing. I started planning out a project for my company that I thought could be huge. I started getting buy-in from various places in the organization. I worked on it all for about 3 months (in addition to being a member of my own team, helping out on another team that was just getting started, and pursuing a second Master’s degree). After so long of being forced to be inefficient, when I finally figured out my efficiency, the company took complete advantage of that without batting an eye. I knew I was burning out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="15f3" name="15f3">And then I got the meeting with the VP. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. They told me the company wasn’t going to support my project. They wouldn’t form the team I wanted. They wouldn’t finance my startup (why not ask?). And they would own anything I built in my free-time. That was the end for me. I couldn’t do it anymore.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fda9" name="fda9">I’ve talked before about this moment. I focus a lot on the fact that the VP told me that if I thought I had something, I should go for it. I really did realize in that moment that I did think I had something.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9a72" name="9a72">But the more I reflect on my career leading up to this, I’m surprised it took me as long to burn out as I did. Corporate life kept bashing against my ADHD. I kept getting feedback that my ADHD was a collection of bad attributes that were the main components blocking my success. I think I started to really hate myself for being unable to overcome these issues.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5f42" name="5f42">Then I was left with no job. Just a bunch of experience and an idea. I started plowing forward with it. I figured that, based on my previous output, there would be no problem launching a startup, getting it funded, and being successful.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b1cf" name="b1cf">Not so much.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7711" name="7711">Turns out, I had learned how to be extremely productive within a corporate environment. There were guardrails in place. I had a team to work with. I had a support system (although one that was greatly lacking in the support that I really needed). I had no idea how to function without that support system.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="06ff" name="06ff">So I got to work figuring it out. I did what I could. Some days were more productive than others. I failed at things a lot. I let people down at times. I didn’t accomplish the lofty goals that I set for myself. I kept hitting brick wall after brick wall. It was around this time when I realized that I am not only ADHD but also Autistic. I see the world a different way from neurotypical people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ee5b" name="ee5b">In my journey, one thing became quite clear to me. The business world is one that is run by NT processes. They don’t make a ton of sense to the autistic brain. There are all sorts of rules about what you should say and how you should approach people. And everybody has different rules that they expect you to follow!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="632b" name="632b">I’m not going to pretend that I have it all figured out. I most certainly have not. In terms of a business, my startup has a lot of work to do. As a person, I have some work to do as well. But not in the sense that I need to change certain aspects about how I approach problems. But I do need to understand how various interactions like those that I had in my first job in the “adult” world impacted me. Now, I’m less worried about how the world sees me. I am who I am (which I am finally figuring out). Once I understand how these have impacted me, I can make the changes to my life that I want and I no longer have to hide from things that I don’t understand.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="fb38" name="fb38">I’m going to screw up. It’s going to hurt. There are areas of my life that are not in a great place. I’m going to have to deal with those at some point. But for now, I finally know who I am and I refuse to let others stop me from being myself. And that will have to be enough.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="99fb"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="f37c" name="f37c"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://personal.guinantech.com/nd-entrepreneurs" href="https://personal.guinantech.com/nd-entrepreneurs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neurodivergent and want to be an entrepreneur?
