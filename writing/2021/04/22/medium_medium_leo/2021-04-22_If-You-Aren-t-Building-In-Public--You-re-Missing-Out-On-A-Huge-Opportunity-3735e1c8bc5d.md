While doing so, I’ve been focused on building in public. I see it as an opportunity to get people excited about my ideas and build up a user base before I have a product. While doing so, I’ve found a supportive community that supports its members. Whether it is programmers building out their SaaS offering or authors writing their book, building in public has a number of advantages.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b4f4" name="b4f4">Grow Your Audience Before You Try To Sell</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e1db" name="e1db">One of the major benefits is that you can attract potential customers to your product before you have a product. This is something that can be an incredibly powerful force as you work up to the point when you launch. What’s one of the keys to building a good product? Solve a problem that people have.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="790c" name="790c">If you are in a community of people who are having the problem you are addressing and talking about how you are building a solution to the problem, you will find that you have an audience willing to listen. This also gives you a great chance to test out ideas or features. It makes it a lot easier to test products when your users are also your audience.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="0770" name="0770">Get Valuable Feedback</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9250" name="9250">In the same vein, you can also get valuable feedback from your audience. Imagine you have what you think is a great idea. You start talking about your idea with your audience. Then you get a response that points out some giant flaw in your assumptions. That is incredibly valuable to figure out as early in the process as possible. The further into a build you go, the more expensive the mistake becomes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="12cb" name="12cb">You also need to remember something. The users in your audience are very likely connected to other potential users who aren’t in your audience. If you are building something that solves the problem for the users in your audience, there will be more users right behind them. If you get positive feedback from your audience, they will likely be sharing that positive feedback with others who are potential customers. That’s why small audiences can still have powerful effects.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="4b55" name="4b55">Make Friends</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4f96" name="4f96">This has been one of the unexpected benefits for me personally. I’ve started to develop friendships with others who are also building in public. When you engage in communities of other builders, there is a camaraderie that naturally exists. It can be difficult to bring something new into the world. Share that experience with others who are going through the same thing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="44d0" name="44d0">Friends also make the building process more fun. Sometimes the building process can overtake your life a bit. That’s something I’ve struggled with. I let the process of building be the overwhelming force in my life. When that doesn’t go well, it takes an emotional toll. Balancing that with the fun of friendships can make it a lot easier.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="e795" name="e795">People Who Are Building Cool Things</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="02a0" name="02a0"><a class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" data-href="https://twitter.com/MeetKevon" href="https://twitter.com/MeetKevon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kevon Cheung</a> — Everything you need to know about building in public.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e8ba" name="e8ba">Kevon is someone I’ve been looking to for advice on building in public. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://kevoncheung.com/building-in-public" href="https://kevoncheung.com/building-in-public" rel="noopener" target="_blank">He literally wrote the definitive guide to building in public.</a> If I’ve convinced you that you need to start building in public and you want to get started, check out Kevon’s guide.

The important part is making sure that you do start. Just make an introductory post on whatever platform you’re the most comfortable with and see what happens. Talk about what you’re working on. You might be shocked by the results.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="0fe0" name="0fe0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Be Vulnerable </strong>— don’t just talk about what’s going well. Talk about the problems you’ve had. Take your audience on the journey with you. Let them see you fail so they can see you succeed. That’s how you form a deeper connection with your audience. That audience wants to support you.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="ae80" name="ae80"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Be Responsive </strong>— When people are supporting you, try to make them a part of the process. Show them you are taking their feedback. Figure out ways to include them in the process. Run a poll to let them vote on the next feature. Fix bugs they mention. Make them a part of what you’re building.</li></ol><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li" id="c4c2" name="c4c2">Final Thoughts</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="5301" name="5301">By now, you should see the power of building in public.
