That’s the position I was in too. I signed up for the On Deck Course Creator Fellowship and started learning all that I could about how to create an online course. Then I realized that I was learning so much that I didn’t know where to begin. I tried a bunch of different approaches but wasn’t able to get anything to work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="14ac" name="14ac">That’s when I realized I needed to design a framework that would help me design the course I wanted to create. And the idea of a community-driven course was born!</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="f9a8" name="f9a8">The Types Of Online Courses</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="908c" name="908c">Let’s start by examining the types of online courses that are traditionally offered. There are Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs), cohort-based courses (CBCs), and hybrid courses.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="4dfb" name="4dfb">Massively Open Online Courses</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="58ff" name="58ff">MOOCs include the majority of online courses. They almost always have some combination of text and video components and have a terrible completion rate. From <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://elitecontentmarketer.com/online-education-stats/" href="https://elitecontentmarketer.com/online-education-stats/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rochi Zalani at Elite Content Marketer</a>, their completion rate sits at about 15%. These courses are self-paced and require students to work through the content on their own.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="1011" name="1011">Cohort-Based Courses</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f0ef" name="f0ef">Cohort-based courses are a fairly new way to approach online courses. They involve a group of students going through the material at the same time. There are live sessions and the sessions are very interactive. This results in a much higher completion rate, around 85%, according to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-06-06-moving-from-5-to-85-completion-rates-for-online-courses" href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-06-06-moving-from-5-to-85-completion-rates-for-online-courses" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amy Ahearn at EdSurge</a>. This was the format for the On Deck Course Creator Fellowship and was my introduction to CDCs. I was blown away by the difference.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="1a5e" name="1a5e">Hybrid Courses</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="63d0" name="63d0">Hybrid courses combine the two ideas. There are typically some self-paced components, with live sessions to reinforce the ideas.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="fe4b" name="fe4b">Components of Online Courses</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="d12f" name="d12f">The Content</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="920a" name="920a">This component is part of every type of online course. Whether it be text, video, audio, or some combination, this can easily make or break the course. As a course creator, you need to have a good understanding of what content your students are able to learn from.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="207d" name="207d">The Teacher(s)</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b286" name="b286">I’ve seen a lot of variance in the quality of teachers with online courses. Many people don’t understand how to teach, so they create courses that don’t do a great job at conveying the information to their students. Mostly, these teachers rely on past success and talk about how they were successful. But learning how to teach can take a course to the next level.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6150" name="6150">The Community</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f321" name="f321">This is what makes CBCs and hybrid courses so powerful. They include peer-to-peer learning as a way to reinforce the content. By putting students alongside others who are learning the same things, learning happens at a faster pace. There is also added accountability that is lacking in MOOCs. This leads to higher completion rates.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="ea6b" name="ea6b">What Makes A Community-Driven Course Different?</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="bbb0" name="bbb0">In CBCs and hybrid courses, the community is included alongside the course. The content comes first and the community is aligned with it. This works if you have the content figured out or you have an existing audience that you can start with. But as a new creator who has only been creating content for about 10 months, I’ve still got a small audience and I haven’t yet created enough to really figure out what works. I don’t have a large mailing list or a large following. That’s when I realized I could build the community first.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7283" name="7283">In this model, the community helps drive the content. As a creator, I let the community direct which content I create. By having the community be free to access, I am able to pull in potential students. More importantly, I create an audience that will help me determine what students want to learn. I have an idea about what I want to teach but I want to make sure that it resonates with students. Having students drive the content ensures that it will help students. It shortens the feedback loop and lets the course creator iterate faster to find the best content.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="8cd2" name="8cd2">Who Should Consider Creating A Community-Driven Course?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="d159" name="d159">Creators with the Curse Of Knowledge</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4707" name="4707">I’ve spent my life learning. It’s one of my passions. I take inspiration from philosophy, computer science, quantum physics, and many other subjects. One of my biggest problems is figuring out how to relate my ideas to concepts that my students understand. Known as the “curse of knowledge”, it makes it difficult to meet your students where they are, knowledge-wise. A Community-Driven Course helps you connect with your students before you teach them.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="219f" name="219f">Creators Who Want The Benefits of A CBC but Don’t Want to Build Their Life Around Running A CBC</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="26f0" name="26f0">I was astonished by the power of CBCs. I thought about building one of those, but I’m also in the process of launching a startup. CBCs are intense to run. I’m also trying to launch a startup. I can’t dedicate all of my time to running my course. This is a less time-intensive option.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="4b73" name="4b73">Creators Without an Established Audience</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c473" name="c473">I’m still building up my audience. It’s difficult to gain enough trust with an audience to get to the point that they will spend money on your products. This method allows you to build trust with your audience while developing your course. It makes it easier to get to the point where people will buy from you.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f996" name="f996">ADHD Course Creators</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3ee1" name="3ee1">This is probably the biggest one for me. I realized that I needed to put together a framework to get me from 0 to 1, course-wise. There was simply too much that I could focus on and I wasn’t doing the most important things. I was spending so much time on everything but creating content because I didn’t know where to start. This made it hard for me to create content.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="0b10" name="0b10">What problems does a community-driven course solve?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="70b9" name="70b9">Student Trust</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9c51" name="9c51">I’m a new creator. I don’t have an established audience. I’m not well known. So why would students trust me when I try to teach them?</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="018c" name="018c">Building an Audience and Converting</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="265e" name="265e">Most creators build up an email list. This works well over a long time frame. But it can be hard to send regular emails when just starting out. A community is much more active even with a few members.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b7d1" name="b7d1">Identifying Pain Points</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="661b" name="661b">One of the issues I’ve had when trying to design my course is the curse of knowledge. I have spent a ton of time researching all facets of what I’m teaching. Building a community around your students gives them a safe space to talk about their problems. Then you know how to help.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="c2c5" name="c2c5">Content Testing</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f29f" name="f29f">Creating content that should help your audience? With a community, you’ve got a dedicated space to share it (like a mailing list), but you also can spark conversations around it. Much better than comments on a blog post.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="21c2" name="21c2">Incentivizing Course Growth</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="383d" name="383d">This is something I’m focusing on. I’m building out a revenue-sharing platform and I believe that this is a great way to align your community’s growth with your course growth. I’m using community activity as a way members can get a share of profits</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b0d3" name="b0d3">Preparing to Scale</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="19a5" name="19a5">At some point, you will want your course to scale. By starting with an active community, you can start with a potential talent pool of your biggest supporters. And by keeping your community involved with the course development, they will see how it works</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="373f" name="373f">Faster Iteration</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d250" name="d250">It’s no secret that you will want to iterate over your course. The best way to do things is to do them, figure out what works, and try again. This gives you the ability to try sessions within your community, record them, and publish them.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="cd56" name="cd56">OK, I’m Ready To Create A Community-Driven Course. Where Do I Start?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="ddf7" name="ddf7">Pick a Target Audience</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4710" name="4710">This is one place that I’m going to deviate from conventional wisdom regarding product design. I decided to pick a wider audience because I don’t know exactly what my initial audience will look like. I’m casting a wide net so I can see who joins. I knew that I wanted to teach entrepreneurship, and specifically from a neurodivergent standpoint. I’ve been advised to focus on ADHD entrepreneurs or Autistic entrepreneurs instead of Neurodivergent, but I don’t want to target a specific demographic. I want to create an inclusive community because I want a diverse audience for my content.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ad30" name="ad30">Pick a Platform For Your Community</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="97ca" name="97ca">A lot of creators choose to build their communities on Slack, Discord, or Circle. I’ve played around with those, but I didn’t quite get what I needed with them. So I’ve started building out my community on a new platform called <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://super.fans/" href="https://super.fans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Super</a>. I’m one of the first users and I’ve been working with the founder to develop an experience that matches exactly what I want for my community.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3b9a" name="3b9a">Start Conversations Around What the Community Wants to Learn</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="6c2e" name="6c2e">Want to know what your audience is interested in? Ask them! Create polls. Talk about what you’ve learned or are learning. See what resonates with them. This is the easiest way to get content ideas.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="87e3" name="87e3">Create Sessions Around the Topics They Want To Learn</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5096" name="5096">Once you get feedback on what your audience wants to learn, create sessions that cover a given topic! My plan is to hold a weekly poll asking about various topics, and then create a session for the following week covering the winning topic. These sessions become modules in your course. There are also opportunities to create paid sessions that can start generating revenue or webinars that act as a mechanism to get people to join your community or provide leads for potential future students.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="69de" name="69de">Reward Activity in the Community</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c3aa" name="c3aa">This is something I believe in deeply. I’m building out a revenue-sharing platform as part of my startup and I think this is an important part of the Community-Driven Course. I want an active community to help me generate content. By tracking user activity, I can reward active members with a share of the profits from the course. This also incentivizes community members to help share your course as they also benefit. The community grows, members become more active, they help market your course for you. It takes a lot of the pressure of being a creator off of you and lets your community support you.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a869" name="a869">Involve the Community in Your Sessions.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7d16" name="7d16">Give others the opportunity to borrow your platform for a chance to grow their own audience. This opens up collaboration opportunities that you might not find otherwise. It also gives you a break from creating content. This could be something like a fireside chat with community members to giving them the ability to host paid events for the community. This creates a way for community members to start building up their own audience and makes it less about just you and more about the growth of the community. Use your platform to amplify other voices.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="117c" name="117c">Package Recorded Sessions Into A Course</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="94c7" name="94c7">Once you have a number of sessions recorded and feedback seems to be good, go ahead and package up your sessions into a course and publish it on a platform like Teachable. Now the revenue can start rolling in and you can focus on things like building a landing page that converts well. Your community should be able to provide you testimonials from the sessions. All of a sudden, you have a high-quality product that can become a passive income stream for you. And you can continuously add to it and improve modules that don’t perform as well. Let the community drive improvements!</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="4708" name="4708">Final Thoughts</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing" id="3b75" name="3b75">This should be enough to get you started on your community-driven course. The goal of this was to give you enough information to get started designing your own community-driven course. By now, you should understand the benefits of community-driven courses and why you should consider creating one. The ultimate goal of community-driven courses is to provide the benefits of a hybrid course with the effort of a MOOC. This allows creators to more easily create courses that can transform the lives of students and I believe this will be an important part of the educational ecosystem in the coming years.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="28c3"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="d889" name="d889"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://leo-guinan-s-startup-school.teachable.com/p/community-driven-course-creation/" href="https://leo-guinan-s-startup-school.teachable.com/p/community-driven-course-creation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">If you are interested in learning more about community-driven courses, sign up for my course teaching you how to create one!</a></p></div></div></section>
