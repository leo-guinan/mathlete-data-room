That means that the first time I do something, I’m always looking for ways to automate it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5505" name="5505">Turns out, this is mostly a trauma response to undiagnosed ADHD. If I can automate something, I don’t have to remember to do every single step every time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84f8" name="84f8">Ideally, I don’t even need to remember to do the task. It will happen automatically when it needs to.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="aee9" name="aee9">What’s the Easiest Way to Automate a Task?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a229" name="a229">If you’ve worked on your business for a while, you might think that software is the easiest. Or if you’ve played around with tools like Zapier or Integromat, those tools are pretty nice for doing some automation. Or maybe you’ve played around with IFTTT.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9f5c" name="9f5c">But there is something easier.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4133" name="4133">The easiest way to automate something is to get someone else to do it. In the business world, you typically do so by paying them in exchange for their work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="690e" name="690e">But what if you don’t have the money or resources to hire someone? What’s the easiest way then?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bbd0" name="bbd0">One of the easiest ways is to ask.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2aff" name="2aff">When I decided I wanted to start doing consulting work around automation, I knew that I wanted to automate as much of the process as I could.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="34e3" name="34e3">The first step I took was to post on Twitter that I was starting to do some consulting work for automations that help solopreneurs and SMBs automate their business processes, which will save them time that they could use to help more clients or live more life.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="58db" name="58db">What Would You Do To Have More Time?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3a58" name="3a58">That’s what automation gives you. That’s why it’s such a superpower.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0029" name="0029">That tweet is an automation. I’m hoping that someone will see it, send me a DM on Twitter, and start asking about my services. Or they will see it, think of someone they know, and pass along my contact info.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="58d8" name="58d8">But it’s not a great automation. It can be improved. Let’s think of a chain of actions that could lead to me landing a client.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e703" name="e703">First of all, I need the client to know that I exist and I offer services that might help them. Eventually, a website will be great to have people find me. But I don’t want to put that much effort in yet.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aeeb" name="aeeb">What purpose does a website usually serve?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a98f" name="a98f">You want people to have a way to connect you to what services you can provide. Ideally, they will Google something, find your website, fill out a contact form, and you will see that basic email, respond to them, and that’s that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1174" name="1174">I don’t like that much work. I’m going to launch a site eventually, but that is a long-term item that isn’t as necessary as it used to be. Automation can help us replace the website. Or at the very least, make it to where we don’t need one yet. Let’s validate our offering by building up an MVP (Minimal Viable Pipeline).</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f95c" name="f95c">Minimal Viable Pipeline — The Basis of Automation</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3695" name="3695">I wanted to make things as simple as I could and as quick as I could. I want to make sure that I can build a way for clients that need my help to find me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7a60" name="7a60">So here’s my MVP. I built a quick landing page using ConvertKit. It’s a headline and one sentence for now. I want to know if people are wasting time with their business and offer to send them tips about automation. I timed it. Took 3 minutes to put up. All I ask for is an email.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="af84" name="af84">Once they sign up, I then set up a welcome message. It thanks them for joining, tells them to expect automation tips that will help them run their business more efficiently. And most importantly, I include this line:</p><blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p" id="f481" name="f481">If you are feeling really overwhelmed with your business and don’t know where to start with automation, I’m happy to provide you a free 30 minute consultation where I can help you see where you can begin.</blockquote><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote" id="8be0" name="8be0">And I provide a link to my Calendly. Calendly helps me automate meetings. I set up a 2-hour window Monday-Thursday that subscribers will be able to grab a slot in.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9aec" name="9aec">When I signed up for Calendly, I set up another automation. When a meeting is scheduled, a Zoom event is created. I connected my Zoom account to Calendly, which allows all of this to work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c269" name="c269">Let’s take a look at the full automation now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="394b" name="394b">Landing Page -&gt; Welcome Email -&gt; Calendly link -&gt; Scheduled Zoom meeting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4907" name="4907">I set it up in less than 30 minutes. Now I can go back and tweak each piece. I can work on the landing page. I can work on the welcome sequence. But I have the minimum structure in place for my clients to connect with me and now I can build on it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ac52" name="ac52">So if I can get someone to my landing page, there is the potential to get them to book a meeting with me without me having to do a thing. If you are familiar with a funnel, this is an extremely basic one. But it’s all automated. And if I can have a consultation with someone, we can both have a much better understanding of whether or not I can be the person to help them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4561" name="4561">And the best thing is, I can put that landing page in all sorts of places. I can put it at the end of this blog. I can put it in a tweet. I can send it out to the email lists that I’ve built. I can do all sorts of things with this link.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="69be" name="69be">I can challenge myself to automate 1 consultation in 24 hours.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="a0de" name="a0de"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/leo_guinan/status/1417591012671856647?s=20"></a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="6172" name="6172">That’s the true power of automation. It allows you to have something that you can use over and over again in different places and at different times. And you can chain them together in all sorts of interesting ways.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3aaa" name="3aaa">Automations of Automations</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5556" name="5556">Once you’ve gotten automations created, you can also work on optimizing them. If you’re like most people, you do things linearly. When you think about what things need to be done, you think about them one at a time.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="38ed" name="38ed"><img class="graf-image" data-height="900" data-image-id="1*6zqF__M-P0frYazfwhVIgw.png" data-width="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6zqF__M-P0frYazfwhVIgw.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Linear task progression (image by the author)</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="4297" name="4297">But once tasks are automated, you can start thinking about them a different way. You can start running things in parallel. This means that things can happen at the same time.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="e9a4" name="e9a4"><img class="graf-image" data-height="900" data-image-id="1*ciqiXujj1AoeS88W0gBGBA.png" data-width="1600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ciqiXujj1AoeS88W0gBGBA.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Parallelized Tasks (Image by the author)</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="15d2" name="15d2">This allows for some incredible time savings. If each task normally takes you an hour, even if the automated task takes an hour (which it likely won’t), the process outlined above would go from 5 hours to 3 hours. That’s a 40% time savings.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8def" name="8def">Automate your life. Create a pipeline that brings you what you need. If you are a consultant or freelancer, build a pipeline that sends you clients. Make a list of the things you do for every client. Do you need to do all of them manually?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6a56" name="6a56">Even if you aren’t, take a look at your life. Think about the things you do every day. Is there any way to automate your life? Make your life less stressful?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="8422" name="8422">What would you do if you had more time?</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="4206"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="87b3" name="87b3"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://consulting.guinantech.com/service-automation" href="https://consulting.guinantech.com/service-automation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you’d like to get weekly tips about automating your life, sign up for my mailing list.
