I spent most of my time trying to raise money. All I needed was something to help me pay the bills. I knew that I had a lot to learn but I had a family. I had a vision, I saw an opportunity in the market, and I made the leap.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="20b1" name="20b1">And I ended up hitting the ground hard. I wasn’t able to find an investor. My co-founder and I were chasing two different visions. I had tried a million little things but wasn’t ever to find the traction I needed to make it sustainable. I kept going back and forth between two models: one in which I got venture capital and I was able to slow down a bit and make sure I did things right and the other in which I wasn’t able to get venture capital and I needed to bootstrap. And in the end, I failed at both.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1fdb" name="1fdb">So I ended up putting myself in a financial predicament. When the startup failed, I had been without an income for 8 months. I was able to get a little bit of help from family, but just enough to keep the utilities on and a roof over my head. And I’m grateful for that. I realize my privilege in being able to do that, at least.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a194" name="a194">Since I decided to shut down DeFiNet, I have been exploring my options. I’ve interviewed with several early-stage startups, but I keep getting rejected. I’ve started looking into finding clients that I can consult with, but I haven’t had much luck yet. I started building out my first cohort-based course and I have had a little bit of success with that. But not enough to pay the bills that are stacking up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3ea2" name="3ea2">Most recently, I decided to build a SaaS offering. I saw a gap in the market that I thought I could fill fairly easily. And I think it will start generating revenue soon. But probably not enough to keep me afloat. One of the biggest problems with building out a software platform is that it takes time. Especially if it’s only a single person working on it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c457" name="c457">In my corporate life, I got used to working as part of a team. One of the biggest reasons I wanted to raise money was to start building out my team. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to build everything out on my own, at least not in the amount of time I had. But in the end, I wasn’t able to.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd1d" name="cd1d">And honestly, I got pissed off. I saw all sorts of money flying around. All I needed was a little bit to make sure that my bills were paid. I didn’t want millions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2fec" name="2fec">When I first made the leap from corporate to startup, I thought that I should be able to find an investor pretty easily.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="778e" name="778e">What I didn’t realize is that I would have needed to match a certain profile to get funding easily. And I didn’t fit that profile. So I struggled to raise and ultimately failed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4dea" name="4dea">While going through this, I spent a lot of time learning about venture capital and how it all works. And something stood out to me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="31bf" name="31bf">The rate of failure of VC-backed startups. But this comes down to the design of the VC model. A VC fund typically relies on 1 or 2 portfolio companies to return the whole fund. When you have enough money, this works. But on the micro-level, it doesn’t. If you have enough money to place a lot of bets, you only need one to pay off. But what if you can only place one bet? Then it becomes a terrible model.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b250" name="b250">And that made me wonder how the system could be changed so it works the same at the micro-level and the macro level. This means that the goal should be to make smaller bets that have much higher chances of success.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="18e3" name="18e3">So I designed a system that works this way. I took some inspiration from the way Crypto communities are run and decided to try to raise money a little differently this time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0571" name="0571">I decided to form a club. The club will cost $1K to join. And membership will be limited to 100 spots. Membership will come with a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that will signify membership in the club. This will also allow membership to be transferrable at a later date.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="491a" name="491a">But most importantly, membership will payout dividends after the first year. I view it like a vesting schedule. Here’s how I’m thinking about it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b0b4" name="b0b4">I’m offering the SaaS at $25/month, or $250 for the year. At $1K, then, that’s equal to 4 yearly subscriptions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0158" name="0158">So after the first year, each member will receive 4 subscription payments each month. At the starting rate, this will be $100/month, and assuming everything continues at that rate, their initial investment will be paid back after a period of 22 months (12 month vesting period and 10 month payback). So after that period, it will be profit on the investment. And there is a high likelihood of a price increase. As the product is developed, monthly subscriptions will likely increase to $50–75.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="458a" name="458a">This allows me to receive an investment to get things off the ground, gives me a clear path to what I need to do to pay out that investment, and still allows me to maintain ownership over the business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="42c2" name="42c2">And the community will act as a steering committee, given votes on product roadmap, and get some additional perks.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b702" name="b702">Pros:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="01ef" name="01ef">Limited risk for investors</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="f88c" name="f88c">Known payback period</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="bc39" name="bc39">Available to everyone</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="c52e" name="c52e">Gives me the ability to easily raise money from interested parties without focusing on raising money</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="04fe" name="04fe">Cons:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="e172" name="e172">Limited upside. No giant paydays</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="38ab" name="38ab">New model. Not sure how it will be received.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="a1a3" name="a1a3">Long-term, I want to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that can build on this model. I see a world in which anyone can take a chance to launch a company. There’s plenty of money in the ecosystem. We just need to allocate it a little differently.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5d5" name="e5d5">I think SaaS offerings are the perfect test for this model. Once you get going, the level of growth, revenue, costs, and value are all predictable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6d4c" name="6d4c">And if this model proves itself to be lucrative, I can see micro-funds taking shape that buy into multiple early-stage SaaS offerings and start returning for smaller LPs. This can provide stepping stones into managing larger funds.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="33cd" name="33cd">I have no idea how this will go. Maybe it will blow up for me and everything will work out well. Maybe it will crash and burn like so many ideas and my previous startup. Or most likely, it will be another iteration along an exciting journey. But I’ll learn from it and make more progress.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ca46" name="ca46">Let’s see how it goes.</p></div></div></section>
