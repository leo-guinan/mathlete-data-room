Not directly, but looking back on things, it definitely gave things a sense of urgency. I was doing so much work for others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="90ad" name="90ad">And nothing for me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f3c0" name="f3c0">I saw so many stories of people quitting their jobs. Launching their startups. Raising millions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="47b1" name="47b1">And I thought, why can’t that be me?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d749" name="d749">So I quit my job. I spent a lot of time writing. I found a cofounder.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6657" name="6657">And I started trying to raise money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5ac7" name="5ac7">It took me down some interesting paths. I was on a Zoom call with a billionaire for a chance to get on his TV show. I met a ton of awesome people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d827" name="d827">And ultimately, shut it down after six months. I tried to do too much. I burnt out. I did pretty much everything wrong. Looking back on it, there’s no surprise it didn’t work. I had no clue what I was doing. I was going through some motions, but I had no idea what it all meant.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6cfd" name="6cfd">Yet, it was also really close to working. I got really unlucky. If anything goes differently, I could be in a much different spot. There were times it got really close. Could I have done things differently? Absolutely. But I got close.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea6c" name="ea6c">I started trying to figure out what was next for me. I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting. I made mistakes, but that’s the best way to learn.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="375a" name="375a">But the biggest realization was that I had let my startup define me. I was trying to redefine myself at the same time I was trying to build it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a089" name="a089">Now, my goal is to deliberately define myself outside of the things I do. I’ve been talking about it on Twitter under <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KnowYourselfNovember&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KnowYourselfNovember&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#KnowYourselfNovember</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="db5f" name="db5f">The process has been incredibly helpful from a personal standpoint. One of the first questions I asked myself was: What do you want to be when you grow up?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a881" name="a881">When I was a kid, I wanted to be a programmer. I thought programming was the coolest possible career and that’s what I shot for. I had a bit of trouble during my undergrad (thanks undiagnosed ADHD and Autism!), but eventually graduated with a computer science degree. And a few long months of job searching later, I finally got my first programming job. From there, my goal was 6 figures. That was what I had always considered a ton of money. Hit that about 5 years into my career.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dd77" name="dd77">Where do I go from there?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ce4d" name="ce4d">I had no idea. By this point, I had two kids. I was in the corporate machine. I was living the American Dream, right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e984" name="e984">I tried to move up the ladder they showed me. But it felt like they kept moving it on me. So I didn’t move up as fast as I thought I should. I accepted that and just kept building and learning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f5dd" name="f5dd">And then Covid made the whole facade crumble. I realized I was living the American Dream I had been shown as the goal. But I wasn’t living my dream. (Also, the American Dream needs a lot of work. But that’s a topic for a different day.)</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="c7ae" name="c7ae">Who Are You?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="2b50" name="2b50">My first startup was more a journey of self-discovery than it was a startup. I needed to get my life on the path I wanted to be on and I had no idea how to get there.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="299e" name="299e">So I picked up my machete and ventured off the path into the unknown. I hacked and slashed my way through the brush as I tried to figure out which path I wanted to be on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9311" name="9311">I took a bunch of wrong turns, ended up on paths that weren’t quite the right fit, and a few times felt like I was really lost in the woods and I wasn’t ever going to find my way out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb48" name="fb48">One thing I wish I had realized earlier: draw the map as you’re exploring. I should have been a bit better at collecting information about things throughout the process. I think I could have spotted some mistakes a bit earlier had I done so.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="144b" name="144b">But hindsight is 20/20. The journey was needed. Now, I know enough about myself to keep myself on the right path. Now, the goal is to document it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9e67" name="9e67">For me, that’s what #KnowYourselfNovember is about. It’s about documenting what I’ve learned about myself throughout my journey so I can share it and hopefully help others find their paths.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ad46" name="ad46">What Have I Learned?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3e3a" name="3e3a">At the beginning of the month, I started looking at my strengths. In my attempts to overcome some of my weaknesses, I forgot to lean on my strengths. I started with Innsaei at <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hashrem.com." href="https://hashrem.com." rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://hashrem.com.</a> #Remarkable is a startup that I have been helping for a few months and Innsaei is a key component. Icelandic for “inner compass”, Innsaei is all about knowing yourself and how to orient yourself to achieve your goals.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="33b0" name="33b0">For the first part, my results told me what kinds of work I enjoy doing. Research-driven and Imaginative were my top two results. As I started reading through everything, I realized how well they fit. If I could re-orient some of what I was doing around these ideas, I could achieve some of my goals more easily.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf71" name="bf71">The second part showed me my energizers. I’m primarily energized by the well-being of self, people, and environment, although just slightly more than others. I’m fairly balanced overall, with the exception of honoring social expectations. That’s a 0 for me. Not terribly surprising.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="23cd" name="23cd">Why Do This?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0fd6" name="0fd6">I’ve got a lot of things I want to accomplish. I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time. That caused me to try to do too much. I tried to force things. I made guesses, both about myself and the world around me. And a lot of them were wrong.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="26a1" name="26a1">I realized I had to slow things down. I can’t change the world overnight. I’ve collected a lot of the information I need. I know where I’m at now. That’s the biggest benefit. When you know exactly where you stand, it’s a lot easier to pick a direction.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="731a" name="731a">There were a lot of things I thought I was better at. I was humbled many times over. I’m working on being more accurate in my own self-assessment. I pushed myself to the limits and discovered where those limits were. Now I’m pushing against them and expanding them a little at a time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c8fb" name="c8fb">Assessments like Innsaei allow us to know where we have leverage. When I’m pushing against my limits, I have to pull strength from other places. Innsaei really helped me realize where I can pull from.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c76e" name="c76e">And now that I know where I’m at, where am I going?</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="649c" name="649c">What do I want to be when I grow up?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="fe07" name="fe07">I want to be a builder. I want to be a teacher. And I want to be an investor.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fe7f" name="fe7f">These are three roles that I think are vital going forward. Builders are constantly solving problems and helping people. Teachers show others the way. Sharing what they have learned with others. And investors give others the resources they need to be successful.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5027" name="5027">I’ve got work to do on all of them. I’m not where I need to be for any of them yet. But I don’t need to be them all at once and I don’t need to be world-class at them yet. But if I keep learning, and practicing, I’ll get to where I want to go.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2ed2" name="2ed2">However long it takes for me to grow up.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="22e2"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading graf--trailing" id="35cb" name="35cb">What do you want to be when you grow up?</h4></div></div></section>
