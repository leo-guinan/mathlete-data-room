It’s a resurgence of self-employment, entrepreneurship, and work-life creativity. Many people are questioning what their work means and realize that for themselves, employment really got in the way of building something truly meaningful. There’s nothing wrong with the rewards of a steady full-time job, but there is real importance in carving your own path so you can live every day to its fullest potential. I believe anyone can create something if they want to badly enough.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7524" name="7524">Every day, more and more jobs are being replaced by machines. And with the rise of AI and robotics, it’s not just some blue-collar jobs that are at risk. Soon, computers will do just about any job that can be described algorithmically — from driving trucks to writing articles to translating languages to reading x-rays. The economy is changing so quickly that there’s a good chance your job could be automated soon. But that’s actually ok.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="651a" name="651a">Jobs in the future will be more about fulfilling human desires than ever before. As technology grows more sophisticated and capable, we’ll shift away from a “workforce” mindset of doing things only because we have to and toward a “playforce” mindset of actually wanting to do things. How do you make yourself into a playforce worker? You don’t need to go back to school for a master’s degree in psychology or philosophy or find an apprenticeship with a reclusive craftsman in Bangladesh. Instead, you just need to harness the power of your own creativity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="611f" name="611f">When you start to embrace this mindset, you start to realize the limitless possibilities. At times, your head will spin and you’ll probably feel lost. I certainly did at several points on my journey. The rate of change in the world is increasing, which has destabilized many of the institutions and structures that we take for granted in our life. Everything is changing and figuring out which of those changes you want to latch on to is part of the fun.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="766a" name="766a">I’m in this for the long haul, and I see the world turning upside down. It’s not just about working harder or longer hours, or even “doubling down” on our careers. We must find new ways to create value — and recognize when it’s time to reinvent ourselves. There are three primary forces driving this disruption:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="391a" name="391a">The Rise of the New Creative Class: Artists, musicians, journalists, and other creatives are using technology to build massive audiences and turn their talent into a money-making machine. The democratization of distribution means that you no longer need a record label or a publisher to make money from your work. And new startups are being formed every day to help them produce, refine, and distribute their works.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="cac1" name="cac1">The Rise of the Rest: Thanks to globalization, technology, and social media, small businesses everywhere can now compete with big corporations. New technologies give small companies access to customers around the world, while social media platforms enable them to directly interact with customers. This is giving rise to a new breed of creative entrepreneurs who are building multi-million dollar businesses with only a handful of employees.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="c2bd" name="c2bd">The Rise of the Robot: Automation is easier than ever. You no longer need to be an engineer to build complex systems that can manage most of your mundane tasks. Low-code and no-code tools mean that anyone can build the system they need.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="5712" name="5712">What the creator economy offers is an opportunity to transform the way we think about work and our purpose in life. The old economy was built around the idea of a job. It assumed that a company would hire you and set you on a career track, where you’d stay for decades, climbing the corporate rungs until you retired with a fat pension. The new economy is becoming more fluid. The future of work looks like a cross between a family business and a network of freelancers. People will find themselves working in different ways, sometimes for one boss, sometimes for many. Some may work as employees, others as independent contractors. But all will need to be entrepreneurs and create their own jobs.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="31f8" name="31f8">What You Should Do With This Information</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="fa39" name="fa39">Information is everywhere. Skills are valuable. Creative ways of thinking are pushing the limitations of what people think is possible, thus we have an economy where individuals can take ownership of their jobs, skills, and income.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="bb1e" name="bb1e">So get out there and start creating something! We’re living in a great time that provides us all with unprecedented opportunities to do just that. The best time to do so is before you need to. Prepare for the changing economy. Learn new skills that you can use to build the life you always wanted.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="ef2c"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="b233" name="b233"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://saasfactory.substack.com" href="https://saasfactory.substack.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Join me on my journey to build a factory to produce products.
