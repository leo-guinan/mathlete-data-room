We learn to feed our hunger for instant gratification through the likes and kudos we get on social platforms. This is due to the rationalizing process that happens in our mind: “If X number of people like my post, then that means I’m a likable person.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="29e5" name="29e5">​There’s been a lot of discussion over the last couple of years about social media and its effect on our relationships. Things like Facebook “friending”, Twitter “following” and Instagram tagging are all standard tactics in keeping up with old friends, making new friends, ex-lovers, business associates, and future spouses (depending on what social media platform you prefer). And while these digital placeholders let us stay in touch with people we see every day, they also teach us how to treat people.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="c79a" name="c79a">How Does Social Media View Relationships?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f182" name="f182">Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are training us to treat our relationships with a superficiality that is out of sync with human nature and destructive to genuine connections.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d819" name="d819">The social media platforms we use condition us to focus on the quantity of relationships instead of their quality and depth.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dc2e" name="dc2e">It’s become too easy to forget the simple truth that lasting relationships are built on shared interests and values, trust, and respect.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff15" name="ff15">To be sure, it was never exactly hard work to forge genuine connections with other people — but it was a lot harder than clicking “Like” or swiping right. Social media has taught us that all it takes is a little effort and the right approach, but in reality, the best relationships evolve organically over time when two people discover they have shared passions, thoughts, ideas, and beliefs. But you can’t force chemistry — you can’t make it happen. And there’s no shortcut for getting to know someone — you have to put in some effort, take your time, and pay attention.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="523b" name="523b">This is antithetical to the core components of social media: instant connection, instant gratification, and all attention on the latest trend.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a802" name="a802">Social media has trained us to communicate without the essentials of human interaction, like tone of voice and body language. We’ve been conditioned to seek out the big payoff and make the quick buck, even if it leads to a series of meaningless interactions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="afdd" name="afdd">Social media is filled with people who don’t stand for much more than a computer screen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5856" name="5856">The “like” button has replaced the handshake.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6ef3" name="6ef3">The “friend request” is substituted for friendship.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5d44" name="5d44">We’ve become a society that’s more interested in quantity than quality, where less-than-perfect relationships are easier than meaningful ones.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3dc0" name="3dc0">But the truth is that social media isn’t real life. It’s a representation of it that’s often distorted by filters and edited to perfection. Our minds have been trained to think this is what we deserve for our efforts or attention span. It’s time to flip the script and start thinking about the quality of our relationships and how they can help us build something meaningful that lasts.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7c08" name="7c08">Sharing vs Thinking</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4bc5" name="4bc5">On social media, sharing is the only way to be heard. And that means we’re moving toward a world where reading is more fun than writing. On most social media platforms — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram — users are incentivized by the platform itself to share content they enjoy rather than create new content of their own.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ecc5" name="ecc5">On Facebook, for example, you can find an endless supply of funny articles and videos to read and watch, but there’s much less incentive to post something original that could be enjoyed by your friends.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bdba" name="bdba">On Twitter, anyone can easily retweet something funny or interesting posted by someone else with a single click. Instead of posting our own thoughts or opinions, we’re clicking “share” on other people’s thoughts and opinions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="58fb" name="58fb">It’s much easier to passively enjoy what others have created than it is to create something yourself. This is not just a problem for individuals who have embraced social media; it’s also a problem for companies trying to reach us through social media.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="138f" name="138f">Our attention spans are so short that we often don’t even finish reading a tweet before getting distracted and heading over to the next one or responding to another person’s post. What this means is that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get people’s attention long enough to sell your product or service.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c963" name="c963">The Internet is set up for social approval. It’s why a cat video gets millions of views and a short film by a talented filmmaker is lucky to get 10,000. Social media feeds are engineered to be addictive: they reward us with dopamine hits when our friends “like” or “share” our content. It’s not an accident that the most successful content on social media is passive and entertained, like status updates or photos of animals riding vacuum cleaners. When we share things on Facebook, it’s not just about entertaining ourselves — it’s also about entertaining our friends. We want to give them something they’ll like, so we can feel like we’re in good standing with them.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="9253" name="9253">What Happens When Sharing Is The Goal?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1528" name="1528">Social media may be a blessing in many ways. It makes it easier than ever to stay in touch with friends and family, to share photos and stories, and to explore interests you never knew existed. But it also has a dark side. Tucked into your Facebook feed or lurking on Twitter is an endless stream of articles. Most are links to news stories, but others are pure opinion pieces. And on those opinion pieces — even ones with no factual basis — the fact that they’ve been “shared” or “liked” by thousands of people can make them feel legitimate, even if the source is dubious or worse.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d908" name="d908">This is what has become known as “fake news.” It’s not new, but it’s recently gained more attention than ever before thanks to the U.S. presidential election and its aftermath. Fake news is often characterized by outrageous headlines designed to lure readers into clicking through, whether for political reasons (Donald Trump supporters), for mercenary reasons (clickbait), or for amusement (the Borowitz Report). Sometimes fake news takes the form of posts from satirical sites like The Onion; other times it’s an outright hoax designed to make money from advertising (or worse). But regardless of motive, fake news succeeds when people share it on social media.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="86b2" name="86b2">So What Happens To Our Relationships?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="709f" name="709f">Whether you’re on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, you’re likely to come across something similar: a post from a friend’s profile that speaks to how hard it is to find quality relationships on social media. For example, someone may post about how they’re disappointed that one of their friends unfollowed them and that they don’t know why.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e11d" name="e11d">Or maybe someone has updated their relationship status to “single” because of the lack of “good guys” out there. This type of content can be found across different platforms and in various forms. The point is that people are actively searching for content that confirms their pre-existing beliefs about social media — that it’s a struggle to make meaningful connections.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a16c" name="a16c">Much like our reaction to clickbait, we’ve built an expectation around social media interactions — that they should be filled with negative emotions, disappointment and frustration. When we don’t fulfill this expectation, we feel as though something is wrong or missing. But when we do fulfill this expectation — by reading a post or watching a video that confirms the idea that social media is bad — we feel better because we have reaffirmed our original belief.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="02b0" name="02b0">This isn’t a new idea. But thanks to social media, the comparison game has reached new heights. It’s common to see people posting their best selves online, and comparing that to how others present themselves, or the highlights of their lives.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="15d5" name="15d5">Tinder is a dating app that uses photographs for potential matches. Its tagline is “Swipe right if you like it,” which means you swipe right if you want to meet someone, and left if you don’t. Social media makes life measurably better in many ways, but it also makes this attitude more pervasive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6302" name="6302">In fact, Tinder itself is partly responsible for bringing validation-seeking behavior to its current level of popularity. The app encourages people to judge each other based on appearances by asking them to judge each other based on appearances — as simple as a photograph and a yes-or-no decision about whether or not they’re attractive enough to warrant a conversation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="74c3" name="74c3">This creates an environment where people are constantly sizing one another up for potential relationships based on superficial things like appearance and job title — which may make for a lively party scene but doesn’t leave much room for love.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="eb03" name="eb03">Networking — Social Media Style</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="6758" name="6758">Pretend you have a new job and are eager to make friends and contacts. Where would you go?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5634" name="5634">You might start by joining a few of the usual networking groups and attending some happy hours or lunch meetings. But what if you could connect with thousands of people who had never been part of your circle before, all in one place? And imagine that those people were eager to meet you — what if they wanted to help you succeed in your career?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="993a" name="993a">With the rise of social networking, it’s easy to find lots of people who want to help, even if they’re not friends or co-workers. All you have to do is “friend” them. The problem is that these connections aren’t always genuine and can lead us down the wrong path when it comes to establishing and maintaining relationships.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="59a6" name="59a6">The Rise of Parasocial Relationships</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="83be" name="83be">Social media has generated new kinds of relationships that don’t always serve us well in real life. These relationships aren’t balanced — one side is usually much more invested than the other. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.findapsychologist.org/parasocial-relationships-the-nature-of-celebrity-fascinations/#:~:text=Parasocial%20relationships%20are%20one%2Dsided,sports%20teams)%20or%20television%20stars." href="https://www.findapsychologist.org/parasocial-relationships-the-nature-of-celebrity-fascinations/#:~:text=Parasocial%20relationships%20are%20one%2Dsided,sports%20teams%29%20or%20television%20stars." rel="noopener" target="_blank">Researchers call this phenomenon “parasocial” relationships </a>— we benefit from the connection without any real emotional investment from the other person. Previously, these relationships were mostly formed between sports fans and their teams and celebrities and their fans. But now, we are all potentially open to being on either side of these relationships. So we’ve had to start thinking differently about how we form relationships with the people we meet online.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc60" name="cc60">Much has been written about social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram ― which is the most valuable and what makes them different. How we are using these platforms is also important to understanding the type of relationships they are fostering. Social media has taught us to think of the people we know as either useful or unhelpful―there is little room for relationships in between.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2274" name="2274">This idea permeates our entire lives, and we have unwittingly internalized it. We now relate to our friends, family, co-workers, and romantic partners as if they are assets or liabilities. This attitude is not only promoted by the algorithms on social media, but it has also become a foundation of how we interact with each other.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ea0" name="8ea0">Social media has trained us to think it is acceptable to reduce friendships to transactions because it can be quantified in likes, followers, and retweets. The number of likes is more important than what a post contributes to building a relationship.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="31ec" name="31ec">It’s possible to have millions of followers without having any real friends. In fact, your number of followers is often more important than the quality of your relationships.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2ce5" name="2ce5">Find Your Balance</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="8285" name="8285">The benefits of social media are clear. But it can also train its users to have poor relationships with the people around them. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to counteract this effect and live in a more fulfilling, connected world. It might not be easy, but it’s worth fighting for your real-world friendships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b77e" name="b77e">Social media is widely considered a boon to our social connections and sense of community. But while this may be true in some ways, it also comes with its downsides. Social media can teach us to define our friendships on the basis of the number of likes rather than actual face time, for example. That’s not to say that social media is bad by definition — far from it — but each platform does have its pros and cons. What’s more, we need to acknowledge that social media isn’t going away anytime soon, so we should find ways to use these sites for our own benefit as well as societal good.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d1ad" name="d1ad">In the end, it’s all about balance. Put too much stock in social media, and you’ll miss out on cultivating real relationships. Don’t use it at all, and you’ll miss out on valuable opportunities to communicate and connect with friends and family. The key lies in moderation. Learn when to step away from social media (and related devices), and learn when to engage with these tools in order to give your personal relationships a boost.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="7bf2"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="b235" name="b235"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://feathercrm.io" href="https://feathercrm.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I realized that I wasn’t building the types of relationships I wanted on Twitter, so I started building a tool to help me manage the relationships I care about the most.
