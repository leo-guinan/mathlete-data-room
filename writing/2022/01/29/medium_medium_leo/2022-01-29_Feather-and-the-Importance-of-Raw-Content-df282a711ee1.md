I posted a theory on Twitter:

<section class="section section--body section--first" name="b3bf"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title" id="8a31" name="8a31">Feather and the Importance of Raw Content</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="3ea4" name="3ea4">I posted a theory on Twitter:</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="47f6" name="47f6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/leo_guinan/status/1485384704232771584?s=20"></a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="8a55" name="8a55">That seems like a bold claim on the surface: I’m just sending people a list of my tweets. What’s so great about that? What possible value could this provide over just using Twitter?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9b1a" name="9b1a">A lot of it has to do with how I use Twitter. I know what kind of content performs well on Twitter. I’ve been studying how successful people use Twitter and how those with large followings approach the platform.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="124f" name="124f">What I’ve noticed is that there has been an influx of polished content making its way to Twitter. Instead of just making offhand comments or thinking out loud, there are long threads, some of which are informative. Most of them are junk, with a lot of duplication. But those perform well.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="3cf9" name="3cf9">Why?</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="4fc9" name="4fc9">Because as more people are interested in creating content and building an audience, there is a lot more competition. In order to hit the kinds of numbers that can provide life-changing income or opportunities, your work needs to be polished to rise to the surface. As more people see what kind of content is performing well algorithmically, they will mold their content to match it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a9a1" name="a9a1">One thing I’ve noticed is that marketers are more likely to have larger followings. I’ve got a couple of theories related to that. First, I think that marketers are more familiar with conveying ideas to large groups of people and getting a specific message across. But I also think that people see their success and follow them to learn the marketing skills they need to use on their own content. It becomes its own little flywheel.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="33df" name="33df">But that’s not what I do. I post about what I’m working on. I give updates on Feather and what features I’m building or where I see it going. I might post about some random thoughts I’m having. Or I’ll share the more polished content I’ve posted on platforms like Medium or YouTube. But Twitter doesn’t like links to external content.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ae8d" name="ae8d">So that makes it tougher for me to turn my Twitter audience into my audience on other platforms.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d7f7" name="d7f7">I don’t want to polish my content for Twitter. I do that on other platforms. Why can’t I just link to them?</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="9938" name="9938">Understanding the “Algorithm”</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="261d" name="261d">So here’s the thing. The almighty “algorithm” that controls everything is simply a bunch of business decisions codified. So in order to understand what the algorithm does, we need to examine what the goal of Twitter (or any social media platform) really is.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5b84" name="5b84">What’s the goal of Twitter? As a business, it’s primarily to make money. With all the investments, this puts pressure on the company to be delivering returns.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0bd9" name="0bd9">How does Twitter make money? Through data. They have a ton of data on their users. They can understand what their users are doing and use that to generate revenue. They aren’t nearly as bad as Facebook in terms of selling data to anyone, but they do use that data to make money. Data is incredibly valuable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8b28" name="8b28">So what’s the problem with collecting data on your users? If your users aren’t doing stuff on your platform, you don’t have any insights into what they are doing. And therefore, that isn’t valuable to Twitter. So they don’t want you leaving the site because they can’t figure out what you are doing. So a bunch of decisions were made to prioritize features that lead to users spending more and more time on the site. That’s what they measure for and that’s what they emphasize.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ba7" name="8ba7">So it’s not necessarily that there was a conscious decision of “let’s nerf external links”, but there was definite action to prioritize everything that happens on the platform over things that take you off the platform.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2fa7" name="2fa7">I’ve noticed that my links to external content tend to only get 50–75% of the impressions of tweets that don’t contain links. This is really bad for multi-platform creators.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="00a3" name="00a3">What Do Creators Currently Do?</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="a042" name="a042">There is one primary way that creators protect themselves against this: an email list.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5d90" name="5d90">An email list provides several benefits to creators:</p><ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="c274" name="c274">It decouples the audience from the platform you found them on. Creators can take their audience with them if they move platforms.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="2ec4" name="2ec4">It gives you a direct connection to your audience. They have a 1–1 line to everyone.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="2d5b" name="2d5b">It gives their audience a direct connection to them. This is often overlooked, but can be a powerful tool if used correctly</li></ol><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="45fa" name="45fa">But there are some downsides:</p><ol class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="8b07" name="8b07">There can be a lot of work needed to get an email list up and running effectively.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="dcf0" name="dcf0">Starting out, you might not know what CTAs you need in order to get subscribers. And your content might not be getting enough views to give you meaningful data.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="2aeb" name="2aeb">You are expected to continue writing your newsletter until the end of time. I’ve seen a lot of writers that get burnt out after writing them for an extended period of time.</li></ol><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li" id="79cf" name="79cf">Enter Feather.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0356" name="0356">Feather gives you an easy way to let your audience connect with you. Your closest fans will subscribe to your tweets and you’ll be able to identify and connect with them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4ffe" name="4ffe">Your tweeting cadence won’t matter. What time you tweet won’t matter. What does matter: saying what you have to say. Your closest fans will get it. These are the fans who are likely to share everything you want shared. They are invested in your journey. They want you to succeed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="62b1" name="62b1">In addition, there are tools that will help you understand which content resonates with your closest fans. Instead of focusing on how many “likes” a certain post got, get stats about what your closest fans saved.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3855" name="3855">Not every interaction is created equal. So why does the data you analyze pretend they are?</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5de2" name="5de2">But What About The Audience?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e66d" name="e66d">That’s great on the side of the creator. But what about the audience? What benefits exist for them?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="56d9" name="56d9">I’ve been acting as an audience for several newsletters for about two weeks now. There are a few people I wanted to follow and make sure that I see their tweets. I was astonished at how much I was missing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4946" name="4946">For as much as I’m on Twitter, I was missing, on average, about 75% of the tweets from people I cared about.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aa4b" name="aa4b">My Twitter feed in no way reflected the relationships I had built on Twitter.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="2f5e" name="2f5e"><img class="graf-image" data-height="1712" data-image-id="1*cFk_RjlR4G2uUCGxkZnPvA.png" data-is-featured="true" data-width="604" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cFk_RjlR4G2uUCGxkZnPvA.png"/></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="a244" name="a244">If you look at the stats above, you should be able to tell when I started using Feather on a regular basis. By using the app as a consumer of the content, I was able to better engage with what I was looking at, leading to higher engagement numbers overall. I had more context to be able to add to conversations. The quality of each interaction went up, which attracted more people to me.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="57bd" name="57bd">Building In Public</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0d41" name="0d41">Not to mention, there is something that people don’t realize about building in public. You can learn a ton during the process and a lot of what is shared is what the builder thinks their audience wants.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9500" name="9500">From my own perspective, I tend to write about what I’m working on via Twitter and then write up things as I think about them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e3eb" name="e3eb">But if you are following along and want me to elaborate on something, I am more than happy to do so.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4f68" name="4f68">I’m building out my course with ideas that come up as I build out Feather. I’m packaging content in sections that I think will be useful, so a lot of what I tweet about ends up getting put into the course in some manner. Getting feedback on what’s unclear helps me a ton.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f157" name="f157">Having a stronger relationship between audience and creator benefits both sides.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="bbca" name="bbca">Conclusion</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e5d8" name="e5d8">That was enough preliminary data for me to launch Feather to a wider audience and see how it works. I believe that the benefit to both the creator and the audience will be easily apparent. Next steps: validate success with other users, get feedback on what works/what doesn’t, and plan roadmap based on feedback.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="bcaf" name="bcaf">Supporting References</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="db3f" name="db3f">As I was working on this, I received the latest issue of Not Boring, and a lot of it resonated really well with me. Specifically, this tweet that was included:</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="243c" name="243c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/998714814749802496?s=20"></a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing" id="0fff" name="0fff">That is the nature of communication at scale. But if you focus on the communication among people who are invested, there is room for a lot more nuance and creativity. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-100000-foot-view?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email" href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-100000-foot-view?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check out the full issue here</a>.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="fde3"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="3a63" name="3a63"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.feathercrm.io/profile/leo" href="https://www.feathercrm.io/profile/leo" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you are interested in following my journey, subscribe to me on Feather!
