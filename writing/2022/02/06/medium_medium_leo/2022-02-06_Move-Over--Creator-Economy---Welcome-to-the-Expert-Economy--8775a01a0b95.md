I’ve been trying to understand the forces at play. On my second startup related to the creator economy, and a self-proclaimed creator myself, it’s important to me to understand what’s happening.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4501" name="4501">And I finally saw it. There’s a shift happening. From influencers to creators and now to experts.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8cdf" name="8cdf">This is still super early in this shift. Most of the world has just discovered the influencer economy and a small portion is working on the creator economy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="496a" name="496a">But it’s coming.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c441" name="c441">In order to understand why it’s the next inevitable step, it’s important to understand certain trends that are occurring.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3613" name="3613">Let’s start with the internet. For the first time in human history, we were able to communicate with almost anyone on the planet. Or at least, the rich people were. Because computers were really expensive then. But big companies made websites and made a ton of money, so other people made a bunch of websites and made a ton of money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dcb6" name="dcb6">Then the bubble popped.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d195" name="d195">Why did the bubble pop? Because people who didn’t understand what was happening were betting on the outcomes. That’s mostly what venture capital is. The people with money are betting on outcomes that they want to see. This causes some really weird outcomes because by making the bets, they tend to influence the outcome.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="903d" name="903d">You can make a lot of outcomes possible with enough money.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0ee8" name="0ee8">But after the dot com bubble, we see social media rising to prominence. These platforms are elevating everyday people. People start figuring out how to reach people at scale. The easiest way is to tell people what they want to hear.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fff9" name="fff9">People become famous by doing this. There is a lot of effort spent on trying to present realities that people respond to. This is the influencer economy. They present a reality that people respond to, and they make a living selling products that reflect that lifestyle.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d271" name="d271">But while the influencer economy was getting most of the press, the creator economy was forming. People realized it was actually quite possible to build a following online around ideas and learning. They were sharing that knowledge and building reputations around that. Their following wasn’t built by the appearance of success, it was built by proof of success. People saw creators being successful and wanted to emulate them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="949e" name="949e">I know I did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a62e" name="a62e">I fell in love with the romantic notion of living on a beach and writing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e444" name="e444">That sounded like the dream. It still kinda does. But that dream isn’t enough in and of itself. It was something that got me started writing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1bbf" name="1bbf">That dream probably gave me enough of a push to make a change. I realized that my career path was never going to get me to the beach. So I made a change and took a different path.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6547" name="6547">As I did that, the dream of writing on the beach faded a bit. Writing wasn’t enough in and of itself. There had to be a drive behind the writing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9051" name="9051">When there’s a passion there, writing is different. You can tell the difference between an article written with passion vs one written with SEO in mind. It’s a connection on a more authentic, primal level.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a082" name="a082">There’s a reason the creator economy is also called the “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://li-jin.co/2019/10/22/the-passion-economy-and-the-future-of-work/" href="https://li-jin.co/2019/10/22/the-passion-economy-and-the-future-of-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">passion economy</a>”.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8e15" name="8e15">The problem with the influencer economy was that it was all fake. People realized they could make money off of people at scale. But while that was happening, there were others using the internet to learn and to connect.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4313" name="4313">Over time, the fake influencers started fading to the background a bit. The problem with being fake is that, over time, people tend to sniff it out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="17bc" name="17bc">One dedicated sleuth? Fake influencer exposed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9122" name="9122">There’s a lot of risk for those who don’t present authentically. People are still doing it, but as a new creator, it doesn’t make sense. There ends up being just as much work. And the payoff, while better early, loses exponentially over time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4f03" name="4f03">As people are realizing this, they are beginning to participate in the creator economy. They are learning and sharing. There’s a constant giving back to their audience. Real relationships are built. There’s a much better payoff long term and much less risk.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2b02" name="2b02">There’s a shift from short-term thinking to long-term thinking.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="59ad" name="59ad">And this brings us to the expert economy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f6ee" name="f6ee">Long-term, when people pursue their passion, they become experts. This is extremely beneficial for multiple reasons, but it all comes down to value of time. If you want to maximize the amount you get paid for your time, learn as much as you can about a subject so you can charge top dollar for the correct answer to a question.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84f5" name="84f5">Once you can do that, it becomes a lot easier to build products based on that expertise. Take the questions you get and compile your answers. There’s a product.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e972" name="e972">And that’s how people are able to scale themselves.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9405" name="9405">Tooling is being improved each day to let experts focus on what they do best. As this occurs, they will build up followings and others will try to emulate them. It becomes an evolutionary cycle that converges to a point where every human is an expert at something because that is how the most value is generated overall.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="58ec" name="58ec">Especially when the alternative, the “safe career” route is becoming less and less safe. Employers are forcing employees into a situation where it’s constantly “compete, compete, compete”, constantly learn the newest skills needed to be up to date in your field, but your salary doesn’t increase with everything you learn. Work-life balance is terrible. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/who-is-driving-the-great-resignation" href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/who-is-driving-the-great-resignation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wonder why people are quitting?</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="75a1" name="75a1">As an expert, everything you learn ends up being reflected in your pricing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96db" name="96db">You can build a much more sustainable business. Unless companies change their working structures or compensation structures, they will never be able to compete.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0fe8" name="0fe8">Groups of experts will come together to work on interesting things.<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-" href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> See Packy McCormick’s piece on Liquid Super Teams</a>. Risk is shared along with upside.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="decd" name="decd">This is where the future of work is heading.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c7b4" name="c7b4">Being a creator is about putting in the work. Follow your passions. Become the expert.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="53b9" name="53b9">People like to pay for experts.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fc2a" name="fc2a">It does take time though. Take the time to build up a reputation. Learn, build, share.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ddc5" name="ddc5">Experiment.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fa86" name="fa86">Have fun. Follow where your passion takes you. Passion leads to expertise.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="399e" name="399e">And since there’s plenty of time to learn before the world even knows that’s what’s happening, get a head start today.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="bffb" name="bffb">Become an expert. And scale yourself. Because that’s what the expert economy is: scaling your knowledge in a way that maximizes your outcomes.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="a655"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="480f" name="480f"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://blog.feathercrm.io/feather-and-the-importance-of-raw-content-df282a711ee1?sk=55a946aa2117eb8b896f7ca284ae8aa5" href="https://blog.feathercrm.io/feather-and-the-importance-of-raw-content-df282a711ee1?sk=55a946aa2117eb8b896f7ca284ae8aa5" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you’re interested in what tools might be necessary in the expert economy, check out what I’m building with Feather CRM</em></a></p></div></div></section>
