He outlined a lot of the issues in the US being related to a lack of ownership in the economy. If you own assets, your wealth is increasing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3131" name="3131">But most people have been priced out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9837" name="9837">I’ve written a lot about the differences between a linear economy and an exponential one, or a scarcity economy vs an abundant economy. It comes down to how scale is achieved. In a linear economy, scale is achieved by hiring people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3968" name="3968">In an exponential economy, scale is achieved by using technology.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7edc" name="7edc">This has led to those with money exponentially growing their wealth. While those without money still trying to trade their time for money. It’s a losing game to play.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96a8" name="96a8">So how do we get people to change their behaviors or attitudes?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="68f3" name="68f3">Most people see the disparities and blame the government. And that’s pretty fair. They spend more time fighting over what not to do than they do figuring out solutions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8992" name="8992">But I think the government can help.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="378d" name="378d">If they want to.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4b37" name="4b37">It’s not an easy problem to fix. Most people don’t understand how powerful the internet is. They don’t see how they can use it to build the life they want.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c6a1" name="c6a1">Mostly because they are too busy trying to survive in an economy that’s outgrowing them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67ff" name="67ff">That’s a tough way to learn.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ab26" name="ab26">So we need a new form of education. One that isn’t based on student loans that are growing out of control. There needs to be something different.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="275a" name="275a">One of the best ways to learn is by starting a company.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="82de" name="82de">So, if I were in the US government and I wanted to fix the economy, this is what I would do.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f509" name="f509">Step 1: Cancel all student debt. I don’t care that it might be perceived as “not fair” to those who paid theirs off. It’s a drain on the entire economy and was a predatory system that shouldn’t have existed. Stop holding people back for bad reasons.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4db7" name="4db7">Step 2: Create a grant program to help people start their own businesses. Something in the range of $50K. But this grant program would have some stipulations:</p><ul class="postList"><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" id="f2fd" name="f2fd">You would be required to go through an accelerator-type program. It’s important to understand the basics of starting a business. Help would be provided to get started.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="a782" name="a782">As part of the grant, a fraction of company ownership would belong to the “government”.</li><li class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" id="03e1" name="03e1">This is where fractionalized ownership can come in. I would fractionalize ownership of the collection of owned bits of companies and distribute a piece to each US citizen.</li></ul><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--li" id="e48e" name="e48e">Step 3: Rebuild the economy around smaller businesses. I think there is a huge potential for a strong small business economy. But I don’t think most people understand the possibilities for creating small businesses online.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e25e" name="e25e">This would make the economy blow up. People would be creating businesses that change their lives. The American people would benefit by gaining ownership in the new businesses.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a23f" name="a23f">The country would become stronger and more united.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3a90" name="3a90">And people would have an ownership stake in the future. A future with ownership is a bright future.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f6a9" name="f6a9">But in order to accomplish that, we need to change the way we think. We shouldn’t be punishing entrepreneurs who are growing their business empires.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7060" name="7060">We should be giving the tools to others to compete with them. Competition is great when everyone starts at the same place.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0d61" name="0d61">But there’s a lack of competition due to the risk of starting a business. When people can’t afford the risk, they don’t take it. When they don’t take it, competition doesn’t appear.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="326f" name="326f">Let the government handle the risk and distribute some of the upside to its citizens.</p></div></div></section>
