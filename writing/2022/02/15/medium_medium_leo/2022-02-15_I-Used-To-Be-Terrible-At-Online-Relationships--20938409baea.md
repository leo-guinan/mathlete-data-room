But I used it as a newsfeed. Didn’t really try to connect with anyone, just used it to consume.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="94b9" name="94b9">And then I started writing on Medium. I, as most writers do, realized I could share my work on Twitter. If you want to get attention with a blog, find two warring online tribes, make a post that is very much aligned with one tribe and will piss off the other, and go share it on Twitter around the other tribe as much as possible.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e0f1" name="e0f1">It works. Nearly 200K views on that blog over a weekend. And I ended up deleting that Twitter account, that I had had for so long. I attracted a lot of hate to my page.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0463" name="0463">That’s what happens when you piss people off at scale.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea85" name="ea85">It blew over quickly for the rest of the world. But not me. That experience really stuck with me because it was so out of character. I didn’t want to be that kind of person.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0e19" name="0e19">So why did I act that way?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="76b8" name="76b8">I started investigating and researching. I looked at how social media really impacts the way we view the world. I realized that I had gotten hooked on some negative ideas that were impacting me more heavily than they should have.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2514" name="2514">Social media is great at amplifying things and distorting reality.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0115" name="0115">It creates a funhouse mirror effect because ideas bounce around and get warped. Things that seldomly happen appear to happen all the time due to the number of things happening.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6477" name="6477">Our brains aren’t the greatest at processing large amounts of data. If you’re not trained for it (and even if you are, honestly), it can be really easy to misinterpret data. That’s what happened to me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="11b4" name="11b4">I wasn’t careful about the input I took in.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="74fe" name="74fe">So I couldn’t control the output I created.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="08dc" name="08dc">The internet is a powerful place. Any desire can be found. Any outcome is possible.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb6d" name="fb6d">But you have to understand the game.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f4ce" name="f4ce">I thought I understood it. I quit my job and tried to launch a startup. I thought I had figured it out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="79f1" name="79f1">I went to build relationships on Twitter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a090" name="a090">I’d seen so many things flourish there. So I started over with a new account.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="294f" name="294f">I realized if I could build up a decent following on Twitter, I’d be able to generate the outcomes I was hoping for. I started working on building that following.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aa8e" name="aa8e">And I did it all wrong.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8348" name="8348">I had a really hard time gaining followers because I was chasing numbers. I was looking at ways to scale my online relationships. I just didn’t understand what it took to build those relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1a63" name="1a63">It’s not something you can scale instantly.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0972" name="0972">It takes time to build relationships. Time and effort. I wasn’t putting enough of either into my online relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="57ec" name="57ec">So the ones I formed weren’t good ones.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7372" name="7372">I didn’t find the success I thought I would.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ee5d" name="ee5d">As I studied how people built and nurtured online relationships, though, I started to figure it out. It’s about being open. A willingness to be vulnerable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="16dd" name="16dd">It requires time, effort, and attention to build online relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2ec5" name="2ec5">When I realized that, I started building stronger relationships. I found people that I wanted to be around and I started interacting with them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5cbe" name="5cbe">I started building real relationships. Online.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="98f8" name="98f8">That’s the revelation. Online relationships are the same as any other relationship.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cfaa" name="cfaa">They play by the same rules. You can’t hack your way to relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="56dc" name="56dc">There’s an odd ripple effect that takes place. You start interacting with people and people in their circles start seeing you on a regular basis. You become part of peoples’ lives you don’t see. Eventually, this leads to audience growth. You can’t force it. It takes time, effort, and energy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c27d" name="c27d">You have to want to build relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0c2f" name="0c2f">But once you start to, you see what becomes possible. Relationships make the world go round. The internet gives you access to an infinite number of potential relationships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="4449" name="4449">What are you waiting for?</p></div></div></section>
