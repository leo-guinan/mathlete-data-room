Maybe in another 3–5 years.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ff4" name="8ff4">Back in 2020, I had a realization. I started writing online and as I started telling my story, I realized it wasn’t the one I wanted it to be. I was stuck as a corporate software engineer in a completely unfulfilling role. I wasn’t satisfied with where I was.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9bda" name="9bda">So I started trying to make things happen at work. I spent three months planning an initiative that would let me make a difference. Long story short, they didn’t think it was a good idea, but wouldn’t let me work on it on the side.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d982" name="d982">So I quit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bea8" name="bea8">And that began a journey of self-discovery. I was telling people I was trying to launch a startup. On the surface, that’s what it looked like. I was giving it my best, even though I had no idea what I was doing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="24a9" name="24a9">But that’s not really what was happening.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6e31" name="6e31">I was learning about myself. And the world around me. This is what I didn’t get from my career. Most of my career was spent being told that I was doing things the wrong way. “No, you need to do things this way instead, even though it’s way worse.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a59f" name="a59f">That’s corporate life in a nutshell.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2c41" name="2c41">As weird as it sounds, the global pandemic was actually kinda beneficial for me. Being forced to think about how I could get sick at any point really lit a fire under me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="75f0" name="75f0">If not today, when?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0212" name="0212">This made me really try to focus on my impact. What’s my legacy?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="81e7" name="81e7">What could my legacy be?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="266e" name="266e">I tried to do too much too quickly. I tried to force an impact.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e10f" name="e10f">That didn’t work. You can’t force change like that. Even if you do manage to accomplish some change, it won’t last.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e6b7" name="e6b7">And then I met someone online who changed the way I viewed things.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3a45" name="3a45">I was trying to change the world all at once.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6cff" name="6cff">He was trying to help one person at a time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="585a" name="585a">And as I witnessed his impact, I realized something. I didn’t need to change the world all at once. If you change one person’s life, you have changed the world for that person. They’ll share that with others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4aaa" name="4aaa">By impacting one person, you can change the world.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8d3d" name="8d3d">From that point on, I’ve started viewing the impact I make differently. I try to impact peoples’ lives on an individual basis. This has led to meeting a ton of people online. But I’m not focused on gaining followers or building an audience.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8dec" name="8dec">I’ve started focusing on building real relationships. Making friends. Finding my people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5daf" name="5daf">Because that’s the power of the internet. You can find your people. You can get to know them. You can build real friendships.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="54ce" name="54ce">And that changed the way I used social media.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b081" name="b081">I realized most people were using it wrong because of the way it was designed. It wasn’t designed to build real friendships. So people don’t build them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5171" name="5171">But if you come at it from the standpoint of really connecting with people, you’d be shocked at how well that’s received.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f240" name="f240">I’ve started describing it as social network engineering. It’s all about intentionally connecting with people and building strong relationships. It’s about taking responsibility for the connections you make with people instead of letting social media tell you who to connect with and how to do it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="821c" name="821c">Now, I’m working in a job that’s actually enjoyable to me. I’m continuing to build out the things that I believe need to exist. I’m creating content that I enjoy creating.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6421" name="6421">And I’m meeting a ton of cool, interesting people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c449" name="c449">It’s been life-changing for me.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="9b9c"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="ff30" name="ff30"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you want to listen to my conversation with the person who is out changing the world one person at a time, it’s available here: </em><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1944068/10241481" href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1944068/10241481" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">https://www.buzzsprout.com/1944068/10241481</em></a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="038a" name="038a"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://course.howtoscaleyourself.com/" href="https://course.howtoscaleyourself.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you’re interested in a free email course on how to engineer your social network, that’s available here.</em></a></p></div></div></section>
