I’m a corporate software engineer, working from home in the middle of a global pandemic.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b8ee" name="b8ee">And I’ve never been more productive. Not being in the office, I suddenly had more energy than ever and I was accomplishing my work in record time. I suddenly had more free time in my life without a minimum of 2 hours commuting each way.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f04f" name="f04f">So I started writing online. And BAM!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ad1d" name="ad1d">I made my first $1 online. It was eye-opening. All of a sudden, my view of the world changed. I was no longer limited by my salary, I had the opportunity to scale my income to previously unimaginable heights.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5a8d" name="5a8d">I wrote furiously. I was going to make millions. I studied other writers. I took courses. And then I made it happen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0ee7" name="0ee7">I went viral.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e230" name="e230">Almost 200K views over a weekend. The rush was incredible. I had written an article dripping with emotion. My dad and I had gotten into a political fight. Tensions were high all over the US. I poured out my emotions onto the page.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0d91" name="0d91">And then I spread it all over Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, everywhere.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5fab" name="5fab">And then I watched the view count climb. And the reactions to what I wrote got stronger and stronger. On one side, I was a hero, standing up for my beliefs against my dad. On the other, I was a villain. A sociopath engaging in emotional manipulation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d0f1" name="d0f1">A war was waged on my behalf.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1a89" name="1a89">But neither side actually read what I wrote.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3bc9" name="3bc9">One of the things I realized is that both sides of the war put all sorts of context into the article that wasn’t actually there.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="df27" name="df27">They were projecting their own lives, their own experiences into what I wrote. I nailed the title. It provoked strong emotions and got the clicks. And that’s what people responded to the most.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e273" name="e273">The details didn’t matter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="da23" name="da23">Suddenly, my social media was an awful place to be. There was all sorts of hate flying around. I received physical hate mail. I was mentioned in articles and on national radio shows.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5f4" name="b5f4">I pulled the plug. I replaced the article with an apology and a dissection of how I crafted the article. It was a true story, but I crafted it to evoke the strongest emotions, because that’s what people respond to, right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="149a" name="149a">And then I deleted my social media accounts. I didn’t like what I had become there, provoking fights and doing things for the views.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4855" name="4855">When I started writing, I decided I was going to help people. That’s why I wanted to write. But within about a month, I had turned into someone else entirely.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96c9" name="96c9">One of the realizations I came to during the pandemic is that I am Autistic and ADHD. Among other things, this means I can have poor impulse control and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/alexithymia#causes" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/alexithymia#causes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emotions are really hard for me to process well</a>. For a long time, I just tried to turn them off. I didn’t understand them, so I didn’t want to feel them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0edf" name="0edf">Writing unlocked them for me again. It helped me process and understand what I was feeling. And it also helped me project my very strong emotions back onto the world.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="63af" name="63af">After shutting down my social media accounts, I started studying how social media evolved. I studied how money influences behaviors. And I studied how both influenced me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="071d" name="071d">And I didn’t like what I found.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="69f4" name="69f4">And since then, a war has gone on inside me. On one side, I don’t care about money or approval. I’m just going to do what I need to do. But on the other, money and the approval of an audience could really help me scale my message.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="75c1" name="75c1">When I tried launching my first startup, this war led to the downfall of the company. I couldn’t figure out how to align certain ideas in my head and so I started down all sorts of paths before realizing they weren’t the right fit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9377" name="9377">But I learned.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ee7" name="8ee7">I learned what it takes to build a company.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0d41" name="0d41">I learned about myself.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="886d" name="886d">And I learned from the people I wanted to help.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9ddb" name="9ddb">The creators. The entrepreneurs. The people who want to change the world around them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6385" name="6385">It’s tough to change the world. Most of the systems running things are built to resist change. Companies work very hard to get repeatable, predictable processes in place that can guarantee a certain level of results for the company.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fd15" name="fd15">But what if it weren’t?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8f8d" name="8f8d">As I’ve studied what it takes to change the world and I’ve talked to people who are doing it, I’ve seen what it takes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7013" name="7013">And I think we need to create systems that embrace change.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6afd" name="6afd">And the creator economy does. There are all sorts of people who have decided to live by their own rules. You may have seen some of them. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mrbeast6000" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mrbeast6000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mr Beast.</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://influencermatchmaker.co.uk/gaming-influencers/pewdiepie" href="https://influencermatchmaker.co.uk/gaming-influencers/pewdiepie" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PewDiePie</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f910" name="f910">But there are others you don’t see. Experts in their fields. Consultants. Coaches. People who are helping the others around them without having a giant audience.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8b9a" name="8b9a">As I’ve been building out <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.feathercrm.io" href="https://www.feathercrm.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feather</a>, those are the people I really focused on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="391f" name="391f">You can reach a ton of people by understanding the distribution algorithms and what works/what doesn’t. There is all sorts of trial and error that come in as part of that. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/celebrity/mrbeast-studied-tiny-details-of-youtube-videos-everyday-for-1000-days-20220310" href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/celebrity/mrbeast-studied-tiny-details-of-youtube-videos-everyday-for-1000-days-20220310" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mr Beast studied the algorithm on YouTube for 1000 days to understand what a “good video” is, both in terms of quality and algorithmic performance.</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6f45" name="6f45">But what if you didn’t have to worry about learning the algorithms? What if you could just produce content and grow over time? What if you don’t need millions of subscribers to make a great living?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bae5" name="bae5">And that’s where <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.feathercrm.io" href="https://www.feathercrm.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feather</a> came from. I believe that future is possible.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e7aa" name="e7aa">And it all comes back to mental health at the center.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ec43" name="ec43">It’s very hard to keep up with algorithms that demand more and more content for you to stay relevant. When you need 1000s, 10000s, or 100000s of views to make a living, that’s incredibly difficult to maintain. You end up burning out.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3693" name="3693">These systems are built to distribute content in certain ways. They don’t care about the creator’s mental health. They care about getting people to watch as many videos as possible.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1770" name="1770">And that’s not sustainable individually. Bigger creators end up building out teams to manage everything. And that’s fairly easy to do if you have the money to do so. That’s what businesses are.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e9c2" name="e9c2">But there’s this weird disconnect, where a lot of creators are really focused on the solo aspect. So they figure out the whole process themselves. And they keep pushing. And they may or may not get the results they were hoping for.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2e53" name="2e53">And sometimes, they end up pushing their content all over social media to try to get those views up. They might try things that go against their core beliefs in hopes that they can reach their goals.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1f5c" name="1f5c">They might do exactly what I did.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="77aa" name="77aa">Or, with Feather, they can create content and publish it. Then they can use Feather to request that their audience amplify it. It’s cooperative in nature. It gives their audience tools to help and support them. It lets them be part of the story.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a42e" name="a42e">Relationships yield collaboration. Collaboration yields sustainability. Sustainability yields better mental health.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="53e7" name="53e7">And that’s what Feather is all about. Let’s see how we can work together to take the stress off of us as individuals.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="338f"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"/></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading" id="b6c2" name="b6c2">As part of my commitment to mental health, I’m dedicating 10% of revenue from Feather to support Crisis Text Line.
