I spent a lot of time building up to the release that week. I tried to get some momentum going and feel like I succeeded. I released a lot of content.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7d95" name="7d95">I decided to try to use new podcast episodes to build up to the launch. Overall, that part went well. I normally get about 200 impressions per tweet. On launch day, I was able to hit over 2000 for the launch tweet and almost 5000 for the thread that I was using to track things the day of the launch.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p" id="9145" name="9145"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/leo_guinan/status/1516052777159561220?s=20&amp;t=IuDN_sZ8-_2LkjY613ea8A"></a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><figcaption class="imageCaption">A thread of everything from the week. There was a lot to keep track of.</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="ec80" name="ec80">The day started off very strong. I hit #2 for the day really early on, but then bounced around between 4th and 5th for the rest of the morning. I was really active, responding to all sorts of people on Twitter, on Product Hunt, everywhere.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6971" name="6971">But as the day went on, my momentum faded. I had responsibilities for my day job to take care of and tried to bounce back and forth, checking on things, reaching out to folks that I thought might be able to help.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fc5a" name="fc5a">I didn’t do a great job of prepping that list though. And as a result, there were a number of people that I meant to reach out to and didn’t, a couple of people I messaged though group DMs that were hard to find, and I just didn’t execute it well.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d253" name="d253">In the end, I finished 5th. I ended up pretty close to 3rd, and a fair bit ahead of 6th. 1st and 2nd were about 3x and 2x the number of upvotes I got, respectively.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="30fb" name="30fb">All in all, not terrible.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7200" name="7200">So What Did I Learn?</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="594f" name="594f">Well, the first thing I learned is that my landing page needs completely redone. It didn’t convert well at all. But the launch did drive well over 500 visitors to the site the day of and approaching 1000 now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff24" name="ff24">Of that, I got about 20 new users.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c6ae" name="c6ae">And 0 paying ones.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e38f" name="e38f">But that’s fine. I expected that I wouldn’t convert particularly well. The landing page needed work and that’s something I was hoping to get fixed before the launch, but ran out of time. I was still shipping code at 12:00AM local time, 3 hours before the launch.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e961" name="e961">I also need to work on my onboarding sequence. I knew I had some work to do there.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b759" name="b759">I was hoping for better results, but I knew the points that were weakest. And that was proven to be true, so I’ve got a plan of action for resolving these issues and will be implementing them in the coming weeks.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5863" name="5863">But one thing I found, and this is the most promising bit of everything, is that the messaging I used on the launch page really resonated with people. I really got some good feedback there. I just need to do a better job at connecting the vision, the messaging, to the actual app.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e025" name="e025">So that’s the next goal up. I’ve got to put it all together and get people to understand it from the landing page to the signup, and through the entire process.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="afa6" name="afa6">And honestly, that’s a hard task. The coding is the easy part. Compressing really big ideas and plans into a landing page is a lot tougher. I started with a big idea. I’ve got a vision for where I want to get to.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2cd4" name="2cd4">But I’m impatient. I want to try to do giant things all at once. It’s the ADHD in me, telling me I can move mountains with one big shove.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="475a" name="475a">My launch ended up falling into the trap of so many other efforts I’ve made. I tried to do too much.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="9974" name="9974">A New Approach</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4053" name="4053">This calls for a bit of a mindset shift. I need to block out the big picture for a bit and really focus in on small pieces. I need to do stuff that matters less.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8aff" name="8aff">It feels weird to say that, but because I’m trying to build something that aligns with my grand vision of what the world should look like, I put a lot of pressure on myself to make that a reality now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5c2e" name="5c2e">If I want to really make progress, I have to practice more. And it’s not easy to practice changing the world by changing everything at once. But I can practice by changing very small bits.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4505" name="4505">That’s a lot of the motivation behind my new project: <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://saasfactory.substack.com/" href="https://saasfactory.substack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The SaaS Factory.</a></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="44e3" name="44e3">I’m going to start pumping out SaaS projects. The focus will be on building microsaas offerings that don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. The goal will be to build very small things and try out fun things. Each tool will have 1 feature, and 1 feature only.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="52bd" name="52bd">And I’ll charge $1/month to use it. Once it gets launched, it will go up for sale on Microacquire.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f35e" name="f35e">My target is to launch 1 each week. I might not be able to reach that at first, but I’m going to give it a shot. Subscribers to the newsletter will get in-depth looks at the products that I’m planning on building, access to the repositories, and free use of the tools I build.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b294" name="b294">Each will have some potential application to the Feather grand vision. It will be some component or feature that I’m considering. But it will be very limited in scope. My hope is that this will help my build-up to the grand vision of reality instead of putting a ton of effort into a giant release that doesn’t really work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ef89" name="ef89">And, if I’m honest, I had a lot of fun launching on Product Hunt and I don’t like the fact that I can’t launch Feather again for 6 months. So this lets me have a way to enjoy that again on a regular basis.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0f30" name="0f30">It’s going to be a difficult challenge, but one I think I’m up to. And it should be fun. That’s the most sustainable way to do things. Make them fun.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="fd8e" name="fd8e">Now it’s time to see what fun we can have!</p></div></div></section>
