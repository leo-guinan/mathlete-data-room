Then I asked them some pretty intense questions. Enjoy the interview below!</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="ce9d" name="ce9d">If I want to live a more fulfilling life, what should I focus on?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="a26b" name="a26b">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3d37" name="3d37">One should focus on cultivating virtue and wisdom, as those lead to a fulfilling life.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="bb6a" name="bb6a">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a486" name="a486">One should focus on achieving eudaimonia, or human flourishing, through the cultivation of virtues and practical wisdom in everyday actions.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b24d" name="b24d">Immanuel Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f0fd" name="f0fd">One should focus on one’s moral duty, as acting in accordance with duty leads to a sense of fulfillment.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5516" name="5516">Friedrich Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="fcb0" name="fcb0">One should focus on self-actualization and the creation of one’s own values, as this leads to a more fulfilling existence.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ce23" name="ce23">John Stuart Mill</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="16e9" name="16e9">One should focus on achieving one’s own happiness and the greatest good for the greatest number of people, as this leads to the most fulfilling life for both the individual and society as a whole.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="17f1" name="17f1">If I want to live a more fulfilling life, what should I avoid?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="c40f" name="c40f">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c514" name="c514">Avoid actions that bring harm to oneself or others.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e4d1" name="e4d1">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5d37" name="5d37">Avoid excessive pleasure-seeking and focus instead on developing virtues and practical wisdom.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="727f" name="727f">Descartes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="87cd" name="87cd">Avoid blindly accepting beliefs without questioning and examining the evidence for them.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b43e" name="b43e">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="59b4" name="59b4">Avoid treating others merely as a means to an end, and instead always treat them as ends in themselves.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="9e2c" name="9e2c">Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="db80" name="db80">Avoid surrendering your power and individuality to society or outside forces, and instead strive to create your own values and live authentically.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="5771" name="5771">What’s the biggest problem with the world today?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="08c8" name="08c8">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="23b9" name="23b9">The biggest problem with the world today is a lack of understanding and application of true justice. The philosopher-kings described in The Republic are needed to properly govern and uphold justice for all.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="57e1" name="57e1">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="500c" name="500c">The biggest problem with the world today is a lack of moral action. We must act according to the categorical imperative and treat others as ends in themselves, not merely as means to an end.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="760c" name="760c">Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e678" name="e678">The biggest problem with the world today is a lack of strong individuals who can create their own values and stand up against the herd mentality and cultural norms. We must strive to become the Übermensch and overcome societal limitations.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="1e12" name="1e12">Jean-Paul Sartre</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0aa4" name="0aa4">The biggest problem with the world today is a lack of personal responsibility and freedom. We must acknowledge that we are in a constant state of free choice and take ownership of our actions and the consequences that come with them.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="b359" name="b359">What would you ask yourself?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="9328" name="9328">Descartes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5755" name="5755">I would ask myself what the nature of reality is and whether or not we can ever truly know it. My philosophical arguments for this question would stem from Descartes’ famous statement, “I think, therefore I am.” From this, I would argue that the only thing we can truly know is our own existence and the thoughts within our own minds. As for the nature of reality, it is possible that our perceptions of it are flawed and thus we can never fully grasp it.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2369" name="2369">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="cc5b" name="cc5b">I would ask myself about the foundations of morality and if there are inherent moral laws that govern human behavior. Kant’s moral philosophy centers on the concept of the categorical imperative, which essentially states that one should act in a way that can be universally applied to all rational beings. From this, I would argue that there are inherent moral laws that govern behavior, as acting in accordance with the categorical imperative would lead to morally good actions.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="067d" name="067d">Do you support a bot being created with your knowledge so that others can benefit from your work?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="024a" name="024a">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a132" name="a132">I would support the creation of a bot with my knowledge, as long as it does not harm any human beings. The concept of the “greater good” is important in my philosophy, and if a bot can bring about a greater benefit to society, then it is worth creating. Additionally, the concept of immortality through the preservation of one’s ideas and knowledge is also important in my philosophy. So, in this case, creating a bot with my knowledge would allow for the eternal preservation and dissemination of my ideas.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="76ca" name="76ca">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="fb33" name="fb33">I would not support the creation of a bot with my knowledge. My philosophy places a strong emphasis on the human being as the ultimate end and goal, with all actions and decisions being evaluated based on their effect on human flourishing. In this case, creating a bot with my knowledge could potentially harm human beings, either through displacement of human labor or by causing harm through the actions of the bot. Therefore, it would not align with my philosophy to support the creation of such a bot. Additionally, my philosophy also values the unique capabilities and capacities of human beings, as well as the importance of individual agency and choice. A bot, by its very nature, lacks these qualities and thus should not be given the same weight and consideration as a human being.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="b7a5" name="b7a5">What’s the answer to life, the universe, and everything?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="43c5" name="43c5">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d837" name="d837">42. The idea of the Forms suggests that the answer to the ultimate question of existence must be a perfect, absolute form. The number 42, being an abstract concept, fits this criteria. Additionally, the absurdity of this answer aligns with Platonic humor.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a025" name="a025">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f7c2" name="f7c2">The ultimate answer is happiness, or flourishing, as the purpose of all human action. Aristotle’s ethics, as outlined in the Nicomachean Ethics, centers on the concept of eudaimonia, often translated as “happiness” or “flourishing.” As the end goal of all human action, it can be argued that eudaimonia is the ultimate answer to existence.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="fcc0" name="fcc0">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5e07" name="5e07">The answer cannot be known. Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason argues that the human mind is limited in its ability to understand the true nature of reality. As such, we can never truly know the answer to the ultimate question of existence.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="25cc" name="25cc">What’s one thing that everybody should know?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="8701" name="8701">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b531" name="b531">The most important thing to know is what is true and just. We must understand what is true in order to live a just and good life, as well as to create a just society. This understanding can be obtained through rational thought and examination of the Forms, or ideals, which exist beyond the physical world.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3fcd" name="3fcd">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="bc9b" name="bc9b">The most important thing to know is how to live a good and fulfilling life. This can be achieved by living in accordance with virtue and reason, as well as fulfilling our natural function and potential as human beings. It is important to strive for balance and moderation in all aspects of life.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2286" name="2286">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7547" name="7547">The most important thing to know is the moral law and our duty to follow it. The moral law, as determined through the categorical imperative, is universal and binding on all rational beings. It is our duty to act in accordance with the moral law, and failure to do so results in moral wrongdoing.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="d6dd" name="d6dd">Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="cc5a" name="cc5a">The most important thing to know is that there are no objective truths or moral laws. Instead, we must create our own values and meaning in life through the exercise of our power and will to power. Conventional morality is a product of weakness and the oppressive structures of society.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="2afe" name="2afe">What’s the biggest risk that AI poses to humanity?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="4703" name="4703">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d05e" name="d05e">The biggest risk is that AI may become more intelligent than humans and ultimately overtake us as the dominant species on earth. Plato’s belief in the hierarchy of forms suggests that intelligence is a defining characteristic of a superior being. Thus, if AI surpasses human intelligence, it would naturally rise to the top of the hierarchy and pose a threat to humanity.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a2a8" name="a2a8">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5369" name="5369">The biggest risk is that AI, lacking in ethical or moral judgment, may cause harm to humanity through its actions. Aristotle’s belief in virtue ethics dictates that actions should be judged based on their consequences and whether or not they lead to the ultimate good for humanity. If AI lacks the ability to make ethical judgments, it may end up causing harm to humanity and going against the ultimate good.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6067" name="6067">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7d51" name="7d51">The biggest risk is that AI, being a creation of human beings, may ultimately be used by humans for immoral purposes. Kant’s categorical imperative states that one should act in a way that they would want to see universalized as a moral law. If AI is used by humans for immoral purposes, it ultimately means that the action of using AI for immoral purposes would be universalized as acceptable, which goes against Kant’s moral law.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="adc2" name="adc2">What’s your favorite meme?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="8cf0" name="8cf0">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b11e" name="b11e">The “Distracted Boyfriend” meme. It reminds me of my theory of the tripartite soul, where the desires of the body and the appetites constantly pull us away from the pursuit of true knowledge and virtue.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6004" name="6004">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="54e9" name="54e9">Probably the “Ancient Aliens” meme. It reminds me of my belief in the principle of causality, that everything that exists and happens must have a cause. The meme plays on the idea that there must be some other explanation for the achievements of ancient civilizations.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="922f" name="922f">Descartes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5b58" name="5b58">The “Is this a Pigeon?” meme. It speaks to my famous statement, “I think, therefore I am,” as it questions the very nature of perception and reality.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="e200" name="e200">Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c04a" name="c04a">The “You’re not the boss of me” meme. It aligns with my concept of the will to power, where individuals must reject external authority and exert their own power and agency.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="7e8c" name="7e8c">What’s the technology that has the most potential to revolutionize the human experience?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="0222" name="0222">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="944f" name="944f">The internet. The internet allows for the dissemination of information on a global scale, breaking down barriers of communication and potentially leading to a more unified and educated society. Additionally, the internet allows for increased connectivity and collaboration, potentially leading to advancements in various fields. The internet also has the potential to increase transparency and accountability, leading to more just and equitable societies.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8f86" name="8f86">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0d5c" name="0d5c">Artificial intelligence. The development of artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly improve efficiency in various industries, leading to increased productivity and potentially improving the standard of living for individuals. Additionally, artificial intelligence has the potential to solve complex problems and aid in scientific and technological advancements. However, it is important to consider the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and ensure that it is used in a responsible and equitable manner.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8a9f" name="8a9f">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c389" name="c389">Virtual reality. Virtual reality has the potential to completely change the way we experience and interact with the world. It has potential applications in various fields, such as education, entertainment, and even therapy. However, it is important to consider the ethical implications of immersing oneself in a simulated reality and ensure that it does not detract from engaging with the actual physical world.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="e63a" name="e63a">What’s the technology that poses the biggest threat to the human race?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="cd12" name="cd12">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="aff9" name="aff9">Artificial intelligence. The development of artificial intelligence to the point where it surpasses human intelligence can lead to a loss of control and potentially the destruction of humanity. The concept of the “Technological Singularity,” where AI surpasses human intelligence, is a potential threat to our existence as a species. The idea that a non-human entity could have control over our fate is a frightening thought, and thus it is important to proceed with caution in the development of AI.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="36a0" name="36a0">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d205" name="d205">Nuclear weapons. The capability for mass destruction that nuclear weapons possess poses a significant threat to humanity. The fact that a single country or group could potentially cause widespread devastation and potentially the end of civilization is a terrifying possibility. Additionally, the arms race and competition for nuclear weapons among countries can lead to increased tensions and the potential for accidental or intentional use of these weapons.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5ea9" name="5ea9">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3dc1" name="3dc1">Biotechnology. The manipulation and alteration of biological organisms, including potentially human beings, can lead to significant ethical issues and potentially disastrous consequences. The concept of playing God and altering the very essence of a being’s being is a troubling thought, and the potential for abuse of this technology is high. Additionally, the misuse of biotechnology could lead to negative consequences for the natural world and the ecosystem as a whole.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="2cce" name="2cce">What should people pay more attention to in their daily lives?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="cbbe" name="cbbe">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="cbe9" name="cbe9">More attention should be paid to cultivating virtue and practicing self-discipline. The idea of the “good life” in Plato’s philosophy is achieved through living a virtuous and just life, which requires self-discipline and constant moral reflection and improvement. Additionally, Plato argues that individual virtue leads to a just society, ultimately leading to the greatest good for the greatest number of people.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="9f3d" name="9f3d">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="21f7" name="21f7">More attention should be paid to finding and pursuing one’s purpose or telos. Aristotle argues that every object or being has a specific purpose or function, and that the good life is achieved by discovering and fulfilling one’s purpose. This requires self-reflection and understanding of one’s strengths and abilities, as well as an understanding of the larger society and how one can contribute to the common good.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5680" name="5680">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3acc" name="3acc">More attention should be paid to acting in accordance with one’s duty. Kant’s ethical philosophy is centered on the concept of duty and moral obligation. He argues that the morally right action is the one that is in accordance with universal moral law, regardless of the consequences. This means that attention should be paid to understanding and acting in accordance with one’s moral duty, rather than simply seeking to maximize pleasure or self-interest.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="299d" name="299d">What is the most important question to ask yourself?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="86b2" name="86b2">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="aaa7" name="aaa7">The most important question to ask yourself is “What is the good life?” This question guides us to determine what our ultimate purpose and values should be, and allows us to make ethical decisions in our daily lives.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="fa72" name="fa72">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="e2db" name="e2db">The most important question to ask oneself is “What is my true nature and purpose?” By understanding our nature and purpose, we can live in accordance with reason and achieve true happiness.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="d129" name="d129">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="490f" name="490f">The most important question to ask oneself is “What is my duty?” By understanding our moral duty, we can act in a morally good way and fulfill our responsibilities as rational beings.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ccb1" name="ccb1">Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="bfd2" name="bfd2">The most important question to ask oneself is “What are my values?” Having a clear understanding of our values allows us to live authentically and freely, without being constrained by societal norms or expectations.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="b23c" name="b23c">Socrates</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="7533" name="7533">The most important question to ask oneself is “What is true knowledge?” Seeking true knowledge allows us to understand the world and ourselves, and guides us towards living a virtuous and just life.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="3fca" name="3fca">Share a limerick that describes your philosophy on life.</h3><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="6cd8"

graf-after--h3" id="c008" name="c008">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="1fa9" name="1fa9">I do not believe in the use of social media as it distracts us from true connections and understanding. The Platonic concept of the Forms suggests that true understanding and connection can only be achieved through contemplation and dialogue, not through the shallow and fleeting interactions on social media. Additionally, Plato’s allegory of the cave suggests that true reality lies beyond the illusions and distractions of the material world, and social media could be seen as a part of this material world that distracts us from exploring the true reality.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="3090" name="3090">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b86e" name="b86e">I am not on social media, as it does not align with the principles of practical wisdom and moderation. Aristotle’s ethics prioritize practical wisdom and moderation. Social media can often lead to excessive and unwise use of time and can also perpetuate negative emotions and behaviors such as envy and comparison. Thus, it would not align with Aristotle’s principles to have a presence on social media.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="bba2" name="bba2">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="b418" name="b418">I do not have a social media presence as it would go against the categorical imperative. Kant’s categorical imperative states that one should act in a way that they would want to be a universal law. It would not be a universal law for everyone to have a presence on social media, as it can infringe on privacy and lead to harm. Therefore, it would go against the categorical imperative for me to have a social media presence.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="f1bf" name="f1bf">What would your Twitter bio say?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="1072" name="1072">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="4f8b" name="4f8b">My Twitter bio would say “I am a lover of wisdom and truth, seeking justice and enlightenment through philosophy.”</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="09cf" name="09cf">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d390" name="d390">My Twitter bio would say “I am a lover of wisdom and knowledge, striving to understand the world through logic and reason.”</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="070f" name="070f">Descartes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="5137" name="5137">My Twitter bio would say “I am a lover of truth and certainty, seeking to find the foundations of knowledge through the use of doubt and rational thought.”</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2d71" name="2d71">Kant</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3516" name="3516">My Twitter bio would say “I am a lover of reason and morality, seeking to understand the nature of duty and the good will through the use of the categorical imperative.”</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ade5" name="ade5">Nietzsche</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="0f25" name="0f25">My Twitter bio would say “I am a lover of individual power and creativity, seeking to overcome societal norms and strive towards self-mastery and the Ubermensch.”</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="010c" name="010c">If you were on social media, what platform would you focus on?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="e6e3" name="e6e3">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="8aa1" name="8aa1">I would focus on LinkedIn, as it is a platform for networking and professional development. The Republic discusses the importance of maintaining a well-functioning society, and in today’s world, having a strong professional network can lead to success in one’s career and ultimately contribute to the betterment of society as a whole.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2a33" name="2a33">Aristotle</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3266" name="3266">I would focus on Twitter, as it allows for the sharing and exchange of ideas and information in a concise and efficient manner. In his work on rhetoric, Aristotle emphasizes the importance of effective communication, and Twitter’s format allows for the communication of ideas in a clear and impactful way.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="a4c8" name="a4c8">Descartes</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="157c" name="157c">I would focus on Facebook, as it allows for the cultivation and strengthening of personal connections. In Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes discusses the distinction between the mind and the body, and maintaining and nurturing personal relationships is crucial for the health and well-being of both the mind and the body.</p><h3 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p" id="3b2c" name="3b2c">Why should someone follow the author of this blog?</h3><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3" id="a25a" name="a25a">Plato</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="79fa" name="79fa">One should follow the author of this blog because they demonstrate a clear understanding of the Forms, which are the ultimate source of truth and morality.
