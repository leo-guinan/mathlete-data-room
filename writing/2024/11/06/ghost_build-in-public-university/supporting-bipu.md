title: Supporting BIPU
---

<p>If you want to support the mission of better, more transparent education, research, and economics, you can support in a number of ways.</p><p>We're creating a valuable network for people that only increases their value for participating in it. So all support for the university goes to making it better, because if the university is better, the enrollment is better. If the enrollment is better, the available resources are greater. If the available resources are greater, we have more negotiating power in bringing in the best and brightest to teach sessions. We are creating an educational flywheel together, so the more we all push together, the less work it will take to keep it going.</p><h2 id="become-a-student">Become a Student</h2><p>The best way is by becoming a student. You can do so via <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/14k29Tfid8ycfdu3ck" rel="noreferrer">Leo's signup link</a> or <a href="__GHOST_URL__/professor-links/" rel="noreferrer">one of the other professors</a>, depending on how you want to allocate your tuition.

Basically, this is a course that you subsidize instead of being a course that comes out of student tuition. I won't guarantee attendance, but if you offer a compelling session, I do believe students will show up. That price is negotiable based on student enrollment, but I'm going to sell sponsorship packages at $1K/session for a 5 session pack. That includes help putting together a compelling course session for students and marketing the sessions. In addition, you'll get a unique enrollment link and be able to earn that money back if you help bring new students into the ecosystem.</p><p>If you want to chat about this opportunity and how it works, here's my calendar:</p>
