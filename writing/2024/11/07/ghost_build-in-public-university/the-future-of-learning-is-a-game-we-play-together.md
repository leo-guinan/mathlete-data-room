title: The Future of Learning is a Game We Play Together
---

<p>I believe the world's most valuable asset isn't data - it's people. And we're measuring them all wrong.</p><p>This insight hit me while exploring the intersection of poker, attention economics, and learning. What started as a deep dive into game theory evolved into a fundamental truth about how we create value in the digital age.</p><p>My journey began with poker during the online boom of the early 2000s. Like many others, I was drawn to its perfect blend of mathematics and psychology. It wasn't just about the cards - it was about understanding information advantages and making better predictions than others.</p><p>But something bigger was happening. The internet was creating new ways to gamble with information. From day trading to crypto to prediction markets, people were betting on their ability to see the future more clearly than others.</p><p>The problem? We've built these systems to be zero-sum games. Someone has to lose for others to win. It's poker when it should be chess - where both players can see the board and improve together.</p><p>I learned this lesson the hard way through failed startups and viral controversies. Chasing attention metrics led me down dark paths. The metrics looked good, but the value creation wasn't there.</p><p>That's when it clicked: We need to shift from attention extraction to attention investment. Instead of hijacking people's focus for short-term gains, we should be helping them learn and grow.</p><p>This is why I'm building an AI-native university focused on collaborative learning. The goal isn't to optimize for test scores or engagement metrics - it's to help people coordinate better and create real value together.</p><p>The future isn't about gambling with information asymmetries. It's about working together to understand more deeply and build better systems. That's the game worth playing.</p><p>Join me in creating learning systems that measure what matters - not just what's easy to track.</p>
