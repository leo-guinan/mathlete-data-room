title: Rethinking Accreditation
---

<p>As I've started talking about Build In Public University more, I've started to get feedback from the world. And I'm already re-thinking an initial response to one of the questions I received.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://x.com/adeoressi/status/1852399132444635497"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-11-at-3.26.15-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1220" height="1080" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-11-at-3.26.15-PM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-11-at-3.26.15-PM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-11-at-3.26.15-PM.png 1220w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><p>At first, I didn't think accreditation was needed. But then I started thinking about institutions and how they structure trust systems, and I realized there is a way I can adapt that to the new model.</p><p>Accreditation as a signal of trust. When I realized this, I decided there are going to be two types of accreditation I'm going to seek:</p><ul><li>Professor Accreditation: As I'm starting out, I'm going to be sharing what I've learned from the various creators I've followed. I want to show them what I've learned from them specifically, because I've spent hours (and likely days) with the ideas they've shared. My hope is that if I can show them that, they'll be willing to add their stamp of trust.</li><li>Student Accreditation: This is the ultimate goal: 100% student accreditation. I don't know how long the average student will take to reach the point where they award the accreditation, but it's something I want to be able to measure. How long until a student feels like they are getting more than they paid (in both time/money).</li></ul><h2 id="accreditation-status">Accreditation Status</h2><p>Here's where things currently stand.</p><h2 id="professor-accreditation">Professor Accreditation</h2><p>Granted</p><p>||Professor | Status ||<br>
