<p>The absolute biggest benefit to being a part of Build in Public University is that you get someone on your side in an uncertain future.</p><p>There's a reason that tribalism has come into play: in times of uncertainty, you need to know who you can trust. Tribes have shared models of reality they can draw on to make predictions, which means we don't all have to source our own information.</p><p>Because it's exhausting to constantly be figuring out who to trust, isn't it?</p><p>You can trust Build In Public University to have your future in mind, because you'll be in charge of your journey. We're forming an opt-in tribe, with explicit values and goals.</p><p>We are creating a brighter future for everyone. And we are doing so by providing open research, open data, and open source. Every conclusion we reach is backed up with a dataset, and we welcome any pushback on what extra data we need or where conclusions are wrong. </p>
