title: Game 1: What's your class?
---

<p>In this implementation, we are going to start with 3 base classes:</p><ol><li>The Creator - creative sparks are unpredictable, but powerful</li><li>The Builder - give the builder a plan and stand back, it's gonna happen</li><li>The Connector - connectors help builders and creators coordinate with each other by bridging the predictable and unpredictable</li></ol><p></p><p>The goal of this game is to help people identify where their skills fit into a random cross section of the population while removing us from the labels we are used to. These classes were chosen because I believe they are the most valuable skills in a new economy.</p><p>The setup:</p><p>My plan is to give a talk about the power of friendship and then introduce the classes and why I think they are valuable. Then, I'm going to present the game as one in which they have to select their class, but not tell anyone.</p><p>Once they've selected it, they will then get to mingle with others while trying to figure out the other person without asking them their class directly or anything with identity labels or their lives. Instead, all scenarios must be fictional. <br><br>After each combination of people get to talk, they make their guess about the person's class, and move on.</p><p>Finally, everyone will be able to see how they were classified vs how they classified themselves.</p>
