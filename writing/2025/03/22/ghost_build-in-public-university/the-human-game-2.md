title: The Human Game
---

<p>A game that has no rules, only players.</p><p>I've been working to explain memetics to people in a way they can understand. And what I've realized is two things:</p><ol><li>Nobody understands memetics or cares about memetics.</li><li>They don't need to.</li></ol><p>Instead, we have to present a game. A game with no rules, and that assumes nothing about the reality we exist in.</p><p>The game is a meme. It is meaningless except in how it is instantiated and shared, because it will act as a mirror to the groups that play it.</p><p>Now, it's up to us to derive the most interesting rules.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="__GHOST_URL__/game-1-whats-your-class/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Game 1: What’s your class?</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">In this implementation, we are going to start with 3 base classes: 1.
