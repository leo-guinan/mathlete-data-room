title: Welcome to the Time Wars: How Network Speed Limits Could Shape AI Evolution

<h1 id=""></h1><h2 id="the-ai-evolution-spark">The AI Evolution Spark</h2><p>It started with a seemingly innocent tweet about Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve – a model apparently capable of improving its own software and hardware stack. While some celebrated this breakthrough, others recognized a more concerning pattern: recursive self-improvement, a potential pathway from slow to fast AI takeoff scenarios.</p><p>But is such a scenario actually possible? The answer might lie in understanding fundamental network limitations.</p><h2 id="the-network-speed-invariant">The Network Speed Invariant</h2><p>There's a critical limitation that could block fast takeoff scenarios from materializing – a network speed invariant that caps how quickly systems can learn and evolve.</p><p>In the physical world, this invariant is the speed of light. In networks (including neural networks and organizations), it's determined by the design of the network itself.</p><p>This creates a fascinating constraint: <strong>you can't observe an event before it happens</strong>. This simple fact establishes an invariant at local time = 0, creating what I call a network's "maximum learning speed."</p><h2 id="complexity-inflation-the-hidden-barrier">Complexity Inflation: The Hidden Barrier</h2><p>As systems grow larger, they face what I've termed "complexity inflation." This concept extends Ronald Coase's "The Nature of the Firm" theory, which noted that companies are designed to have a transaction cost of zero within the organization.</p><p>But here's the problem: when transactions have zero cost, organizations typically don't track them. Why would you track something that costs nothing?</p><p>The reality is these transactions <em>do</em> have costs, and these costs grow exponentially as the system scales. This complexity inflation creates a memetic threat vector by limiting the maximum speed a network can operate at – similar to how the speed of light works in physics.</p><h2 id="timeline-poisoning-the-strategic-threat">Timeline Poisoning: The Strategic Threat</h2><p>When there's a gap between value creation and recognition, opportunities arise for malicious actors to siphon off recognition, eventually capturing most of the value created by others.</p><p>I call this "timeline poisoning," and it's made possible by attacking the temporal misalignment of value. This threat emerges when we limit how measurably we can track value creation in complex processes.</p><h2 id="the-sports-league-analogy">The Sports League Analogy</h2><p>Professional sports provide an excellent metaphor for understanding these concepts. Sports leagues operate at the edge of technology adoption, where every slight advantage is crucial for winning. The best teams update to changing landscapes fastest, forcing competitors to play catch-up.</p><p>Consider how top soccer clubs build global scouting networks to identify talent early. This serves two purposes: value capture and value development. Resources allow some clubs to acquire the best players, preventing competitors from accessing them. Meanwhile, clubs with fewer resources focus on development, later selling players to larger organizations.</p><h2 id="timeline-poisoning-in-action">Timeline Poisoning in Action</h2><p>Imagine a soccer club identifying a player with high potential, but then giving them a reversible performance-limiting factor. This makes their ability appear capped at a much lower level to all observers, dropping the player's market value. The club can then acquire them at a bargain price before removing the limitation and revealing their true potential.</p><p>This becomes possible when you can recognize where a slower-moving system is heading and add strategic noise to affect observations within the system.</p><h2 id="building-temporal-bridge-institutions">Building Temporal Bridge Institutions</h2><p>To protect against timeline poisoning, we need "temporal bridge institutions" – systems designed to minimize the gap between value creation and observation. These institutions ensure all value creation is observed and registered locally before being distributed through networks.</p><p>Professional sports leagues exemplify such institutions. They exist at any moment in time, with results standing at the end of a competitive season. Afterward, participants return to the drawing board to adjust strategies based on observed outcomes.</p><h2 id="the-path-forward">The Path Forward</h2><p>As AI systems like AlphaEvolve push boundaries of self-improvement, understanding these network dynamics becomes increasingly important. Many organizations will begin failing due to timeline poisoning, and we need diagnostic tools to identify these issues before irreversible damage occurs.</p><p>By recognizing the inherent speed limits in our networks and protecting against timeline poisoning, we can build more resilient systems that properly attribute and reward value creation – whether in AI development, organizational design, or broader economic structures.</p><p>Welcome to the time wars. Our greatest threat vector is our timeline, and building systems that protect against this vulnerability may be our most important challenge yet.</p><hr><p><em>This post expands on concepts from Ronald Coase's "The Nature of the Firm" and explores their application to modern network theory and artificial intelligence.</em></p>
