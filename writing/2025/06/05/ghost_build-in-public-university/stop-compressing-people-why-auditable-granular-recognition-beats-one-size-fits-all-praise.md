title: Stop Compressing People: Why Auditable, Granular Recognition Beats One-Size-Fits-All Praise
---

<p><em>Most performance systems still treat recognition like confetti: toss a handful at the crowd and hope it lands near the right person. The result is a compression artifact—unique contributions blurred into a low-resolution composite. In a world where “being seen” is the very foundation of value creation, that blur is costly.</em></p><hr><h3 id="1-recognition-isn%E2%80%99t-a-nice-to-have%E2%80%94it-is-the-asset">1. Recognition Isn’t a Nice-to-Have—It <em>Is</em> the Asset</h3><p>Memetic-economics research shows that economic value begins the moment at least one community actually <strong>sees</strong> your work The Memetic Foundation ….
