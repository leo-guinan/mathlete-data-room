title: Eat the Complexity So Your Users Don’t Have To
---

<p><em>Why the best indie products feel magical—except from the founder’s seat</em></p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3><p>The better you understand a problem, the simpler it <em>looks</em>—to you. To your users, every new setting, acronym, or edge‑case workaround is cognitive rent. Your real job is to swallow that complexity and serve a dish so intuitive it feels inevitable.</p><hr><p><strong>1. The Complexity Inversion</strong></p>

Cognitive Load: The Silent Churn Engine</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Time‑to‑First‑Value</strong> – Each extra click postpones the dopamine that turns dabblers into die‑hards.</li><li><strong>Decision Fatigue</strong> – Optionality excites founders, exhausts users.</li><li><strong>Error Anxiety</strong> – More knobs = more ways to feel dumb.</li></ul><p>Open Stripe. Count the items you <em>could</em> break. Now remember they hide 90 % of the danger behind defaults.</p><hr><p><strong>3. The Three‑Course Complexity Diet</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Ingest</strong> – Internal tools, scripts, and ugly admin screens absorb the mess.</li><li><strong>Digest</strong> – Opinionated, one‑click defaults do the choosing for 80 % of people.</li><li><strong>Excrete</strong> – Ruthless feature funerals.

Ship Less, Delight More</strong></p><p>Empathy, not code, is your unfair advantage. Each day you either internalize complexity—or export it to the user’s frontal cortex. Only one path scales.</p><blockquote>“Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”<br>—Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry</blockquote><p>Keep eating the complexity so your users can feast on clarity.</p>
