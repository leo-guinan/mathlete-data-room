title: The System Is Eating Itself
---

<p>The collapse isn't coming—it's here. Every day, another engineer games the system. Every week, another founder fakes their metrics. Every month, another unicorn admits its numbers were lies. Silicon Valley hasn't lost its way. It's eating itself alive.</p><h2 id="the-infection-spreads-daily">The Infection Spreads Daily</h2><p>Meet Soham Parekh. Mumbai-based engineer. Last month, collected $40,000 from four Silicon Valley startups. Simultaneously. None knew about the others. When exposed, he immediately landed another founding engineer role. The system didn't punish him. It promoted him.</p><p>This isn't isolated. It's systematic. Dozens of founders discovered they'd hired the same phantom employees. Remote work didn't create opportunity—it created perfect cover for mass deception. The builders aren't building. They're extracting.</p><p>Watch what happens next: More engineers follow Parekh's playbook. More startups hemorrhage capital to ghosts. The honest engineers—the ones actually shipping code—leave for industries that still verify reality. Q3 2025: Engineering salaries spike 40% as real talent becomes scarce. Q4: The first major startup fails because its entire engineering team never existed.</p><h2 id="andreessen-horowitz-funds-cheat-on-everything">Andreessen Horowitz Funds "Cheat on Everything"</h2><p>Two Columbia students get suspended for building interview-cheating AI. Their punishment? $15 million from Marc Andreessen. Their new company, Cluely, sells one product: deception at scale. Company tagline: "Cheat on Everything." Not metaphorically. Literally.</p><p>Roy Lee used his own tool to fake his way into Amazon, Meta, TikTok. Now he sells that same deception to others. Revenue jumped from $3 million to $7 million in one week. A public company just signed a $2.5 million contract to help their employees cheat better.</p><p>Silicon Valley's best investors aren't funding innovation. They're funding the tools that destroy trust itself. When cheating becomes a fundable business model, the game is already over.</p><h2 id="prison-sentences-multiply-nothing-changes">Prison Sentences Multiply. Nothing Changes.</h2><p>HeadSpin's CEO claimed $54 million in revenue. Real number: $13 million. His reward: $117 million in funding at a billion-dollar valuation. His punishment, eventually: 18 months in prison. The investors who believed obvious lies? They're funding the next fraud right now.</p><p>Arrayit claimed a $4.5 billion valuation while approaching bankruptcy. Complete fabrication. Eight years in prison for the CEO. The VCs who wrote checks without basic diligence? Already deployed that capital into three new scams.</p><p>North Korean operatives infiltrated 300 US companies using fake identities and deepfakes. They extracted $88 million to fund weapons programs. Silicon Valley's response? Double down on remote hiring with even less verification.</p><p>The prosecutions accelerate. The fraud accelerates faster. The system rewards successful deception until the law catches up, years later. By then, the smart criminals have already exited to Dubai.</p><h2 id="truth-died-in-2024">Truth Died in 2024</h2><p>Silicon Valley killed California's AI safety bill with coordinated lies. Y Combinator and venture capitalists spread false claims about developers going to jail. Complete fabrication. But it worked. The bill died.</p><p>The industry spent $260 million on lobbying in four years. That's 500 lobbyists—one for every two members of Congress. They don't argue facts. They manufacture alternate realities. Post-truth isn't a bug. It's the business model.</p><p>Meanwhile, every major platform dismantled their trust and safety teams. Content moderation exists only as political theater—deployed under scrutiny, abandoned when the heat dies down. They know they're spreading lies. They've systematized it.</p><p>China builds cities while we build manipulation tools. Singapore processes business permits in 24 hours while we take four months. Not because of regulation—because our best minds optimize for deception instead of creation.</p><h2 id="the-cancer-metastasizes">The Cancer Metastasizes</h2><p>Every successful manipulation spawns ten imitators. Every funded fraud validates the next one. The honest founders can't compete with those willing to lie. So they leave. Or they start lying too.</p><p>Sarah Chen, MIT's brightest, now packages debt derivatives so complex she admits nobody understands them. "We just trust the models," she laughs. The models are built on fake data from companies with fake metrics run by fake employees.</p><p>Watch the insiders: They're buying farmland. Building bunkers. Hoarding physical assets. They see what's coming because they created it. When the architects flee their own creation, the collapse has already begun.</p><h2 id="two-futures-only-two">Two Futures. Only Two.</h2><p>Path One: We build systems that assume everyone lies. Every credential, verified cryptographically. Every claim, independently audited. Every interaction, documented immutably. Trust becomes algorithmic because human trust is dead. It's expensive. It's slow. But it functions.</p><p>Path Two: The manipulation economy accelerates until nothing real remains. Fake employees building fake products for fake companies with fake revenue. Capital floods toward the best liars. Innovation dies. China and Singapore divide our carcass while we argue about whose lies were prettier.</p><p>No third option exists. History is clear: When deception becomes more profitable than creation, civilizations don't reform. They collapse.</p><h2 id="the-binary-choice">The Binary Choice</h2><p>Those promising gradual reform sell fantasies. The cancer has metastasized. The patient isn't sick—it's dying. Every day we delay, another Soham Parekh multiplies. Another Cluely gets funded. Another trust-based system fails.</p><p>The builders still exist. Trapped in a system that punishes honesty. Waiting for someone to create structures where merit matters more than manipulation. Where verification trumps virality. Where the game can't be gamed.</p><p>But here's what the VCs don't want you to know: The solution already exists. Cryptographic verification. Zero-knowledge proofs. Immutable audit trails. The technology to build trust-minimized systems shipped years ago. We just chose manipulation instead.</p><p>Your choice: Build systems that assume everyone cheats—because they do. Or watch Silicon Valley finish eating itself. The window closes in months, not years. After that, the question isn't whether the system collapses, but who picks up the pieces.</p><p>The exodus accelerates. The builders flee. The window closes.</p><p>Choose now. Build now. The alternative is darkness.</p><p>Begin.</p>
