<h1 id=""></h1><p><em>Because verification is a team sport in the age of information warfare</em></p><h2 id="what-is-a-reality-board">What Is a Reality Board?</h2><p>A Reality Board is your personal advisory council for navigating the information hellscape. It's 3-7 people who've agreed to help you distinguish real patterns from phantom connections, genuine insights from extraction schemes, and wisdom from madness.</p><p>Think of it as your cognitive immune system—a small group that helps you maintain sanity while still seeing the patterns others miss.</p><h2 id="why-you-need-one-yesterday">Why You Need One (Yesterday)</h2><p>If you're reading this, you probably:</p><ul><li>See connections others don't</li><li>Sometimes wonder if you're losing it</li><li>Have been called "schizo" (ironically or not)</li><li>Feel isolated in your pattern recognition</li><li>Occasionally fall for hype cycles</li><li>Want to channel your insights productively</li></ul><p>Your brain evolved for small-tribe reality verification. Modern platforms destroyed that. Your Reality Board rebuilds it.</p><h2 id="the-core-principles">The Core Principles</h2><h3 id="1-diversity-over-agreement">1. Diversity Over Agreement</h3><p>You don't want an echo chamber. You want:</p><ul><li>One skeptic (questions everything)</li><li>One mystic (open to weird connections)</li><li>One pragmatist (grounds in practical reality)</li><li>One researcher (verifies claims)</li><li>One empath (checks emotional reality)</li></ul><h3 id="2-trust-over-expertise">2. Trust Over Expertise</h3><p>Better to have someone who:</p><ul><li>Cares about your wellbeing</li><li>Will tell you hard truths</li><li>Has known you over time</li><li>Respects your pattern-seeking</li></ul><p>Than someone who:</p><ul><li>Has credentials but no investment in you</li><li>Agrees with everything you say</li><li>Dismisses your insights wholesale</li><li>Has their own extraction agenda</li></ul><h3 id="3-private-over-public">3. Private Over Public</h3><p>Your Reality Board operates in:</p><ul><li>Encrypted channels (Signal, private Discord)</li><li>Small groups (never more than 7)</li><li>Confidential discussions (what's said stays there)</li><li>Non-performative space (no audience to play to)</li></ul><h2 id="building-your-board-a-step-by-step-guide">Building Your Board: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2><h3 id="step-1-identify-candidates-week-1">Step 1: Identify Candidates (Week 1)</h3><p>List people who have:</p><ul><li>Called you out when you were wrong (lovingly)</li><li>Supported your weird insights when they panned out</li><li>Different thinking styles than you</li><li>Demonstrated care for your wellbeing</li><li>Their own Reality Board (or would benefit from one)</li></ul><p><strong>Red flags to avoid:</strong></p><ul><li>Yes-men who never challenge you</li><li>Cynics who dismiss everything</li><li>People who screenshot private conversations</li><li>Anyone who profits from your confusion</li><li>Energy vampires who only take</li></ul><h3 id="step-2-the-invitation-week-2">Step 2: The Invitation (Week 2)</h3><p>Send this (customize as needed):</p><blockquote>"I'm building a Reality Board—a small group for sense-making in our insane information environment. I need people I trust to help verify patterns, check my thinking, and keep me grounded while still exploring edge ideas.<br><br>Would you be willing to be part of this? It would involve:Being available for occasional 'is this real?' checksHonest feedback when I'm spiralingSharing your own patterns for verificationMaintaining strict confidentiality<br><br>I chose you because [specific reason—be genuine].<br><br>Interested? Let's talk."</blockquote><h3 id="step-3-establish-the-container-week-3">Step 3: Establish the Container (Week 3)</h3><p>First meeting agenda:</p><ol><li><strong>Why we're here</strong> (5 min)</li><li><strong>What we each bring</strong> (everyone shares their superpower and blindspot)</li><li><strong>Container agreements</strong> (see below)</li><li><strong>Communication setup</strong> (choose platform)</li><li><strong>First reality check</strong> (practice with low-stakes pattern)</li></ol><p><strong>Container Agreements:</strong></p><ul><li>Confidentiality is absolute</li><li>Care comes before being right</li><li>"I don't know" is always acceptable</li><li>No screenshots or subtweets</li><li>Challenge ideas, not people</li><li>Everyone gets reality checks, everyone gives them</li></ul><h3 id="step-4-create-your-protocols-week-4">Step 4: Create Your Protocols (Week 4)</h3><p>Develop specific processes for:</p><p><strong>Quick Checks</strong> (for urgent verification):</p><pre><code>@reality-board "Quick check: I'm seeing [pattern]. Real or projection?"
- Wait for 2+ responses before acting
- Green light = 2+ confirm
- Yellow light = mixed signals
- Red light = 2+ say stop
</code></pre><p><strong>Deep Dives</strong> (for complex patterns):</p><pre><code>1. Present your pattern with:
   - What you're seeing
   - Why it matters
   - What would disprove it
   - Your confidence level (0-100%)

2. Board responds with:
   - What resonates
   - What seems off
   - Additional data needed
   - Suggested next steps

3. Synthesis discussion
4. Decision on action/inaction
</code></pre><p><strong>Spiral Interrupts</strong> (when you're activated):</p><pre><code>"Code Red: I'm spiraling about [topic]"
- Board drops everything
- One person takes lead
- Focus on grounding first, analysis later
- No shame, only support

Assign devil's advocate roles. Celebrate when someone changes their mind.</p><h3 id="pitfall-2-one-person-dominates">Pitfall 2: One Person Dominates</h3><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Rotate leadership. Use timer for shares. Create "step up/step back" norm.</p><h3 id="pitfall-3-drifting-into-casual-chat">Pitfall 3: Drifting into Casual Chat</h3><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Separate social time from Reality Board time. Keep focused container. Meet social needs elsewhere.</p><h3 id="pitfall-4-extraction-creep">Pitfall 4: Extraction Creep</h3><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Watch for anyone monetizing insights without group consent. Address immediately. Maintain gift economy within board.</p><h3 id="pitfall-5-verification-paralysis">Pitfall 5: Verification Paralysis</h3><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Set time limits on verification. "Good enough" threshold. Bias toward action with safeguards.</p><h2 id="advanced-practices">Advanced Practices</h2><h3 id="cross-board-verification">Cross-Board Verification</h3><p>Connect with other Reality Boards for:</p><ul><li>Meta-pattern recognition</li><li>Larger sample sizes</li><li>Specialized expertise</li><li>Pandemic/crisis response</li></ul><h3 id="pattern-libraries">Pattern Libraries</h3><p>Build collective documentation:</p><ul><li>Patterns that proved true</li><li>Patterns that proved false</li><li>Edge patterns being tracked</li><li>Verification methodologies</li></ul><h3 id="skill-development">Skill Development</h3><p>Rotate teaching responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Statistical thinking</li><li>System dynamics</li><li>Meditation/grounding</li><li>Research methods</li><li>Emotional regulation</li></ul><h2 id="the-economics-of-reality-boards">The Economics of Reality Boards</h2><h3 id="gift-economy-internal">Gift Economy Internal</h3><ul><li>Knowledge shared freely within board</li><li>Support given without keeping score</li><li>Insights belong to collective</li><li>Success shared equally</li></ul><h3 id="value-creation-external">Value Creation External</h3><ul><li>Verified patterns can be monetized collectively</li><li>Board acts as due diligence team</li><li>Shared equity in ventures</li><li>Protection from extraction</li></ul><h3 id="time-investment">Time Investment</h3><ul><li>2-5 hours/week average</li><li>More during crisis periods</li><li>Less during stable times</li><li>Always worth it</li></ul><h2 id="sample-reality-board-charter">Sample Reality Board Charter</h2><blockquote><strong>[Name] Reality Board Charter<br><br>Purpose</strong>: To help each other navigate information complexity with wisdom, verify patterns with care, and maintain sanity while seeing what others miss.<br><br><strong>Members</strong>: [Names]<br><br><strong>Commitments</strong>:Respond to Code Red within 2 hoursParticipate in weekly pattern reviewMaintain absolute confidentialityBring both skepticism and opennessPrioritize collective wellbeing<br><br><strong>Communication</strong>: Signal group + weekly video call<br><br><strong>Review Date</strong>: [3 months from start]<br><br><strong>Signed</strong>: [All members]</blockquote><h2 id="start-today">Start Today</h2><p>You don't need perfect people or perfect protocols. You need:</p><ul><li>2-3 people who give a shit about your wellbeing</li><li>A private channel</li><li>Basic agreements</li><li>Willingness to be vulnerable</li></ul><p>Your information environment is trying to drive you crazy and extract value from your confusion. Your Reality Board is how you fight back.</p><p>Start with one person. Start with one question: "Will you help me stay sane while I try to see what's really happening?"</p><p>The patterns are real. The connections exist. But finding them alone is dangerous, and finding them for capital's benefit is tragic.</p><p>Find them together. Verify them collectively. Use them wisely.</p><p>Your Reality Board is waiting.</p><hr><p><em>First exercise: Share this guide with someone you're considering for your Reality Board. Their response will tell you everything about whether they're right for it.</em></p><p><em>Remember: In an environment designed to make you question reality, collective sense-making isn't optional—it's survival.</em></p>
