<p>A differential is therefore not just a personal hurdle; it is an <strong>ecosystem gradient</strong> that demands coordinated re-wiring of information flows, energy inputs, and trust networks.</p><hr><h2 id="3-phase-transitions-and-non-linear-jumps">3 | Phase Transitions and Non-Linear Jumps</h2><p>Complex systems accumulate potential until a critical threshold triggers re-configuration—a <strong>phase transition</strong>. Manifestation often feels like “nothing-nothing-BAM!” because the <em>order parameters</em> (skills, capital, consensus) finally pass the tipping point. Hyperstition—fictions that make themselves real—exploits this by seeding beliefs that accelerate the approach to criticality.</p><hr><h2 id="4-the-political-economy-of-manifestation">4 | The Political Economy of Manifestation</h2><h3 id="41-funding-the-gradient">4.1 Funding the Gradient</h3><p>Those who control capital decide which differentials are “realistic.” The result is a <strong>manifestation class system</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Funded Class</strong> – multiple attempts are subsidized; failure is framed as learning.</li><li><strong>Starved Class</strong> – visions are labeled delusional; potential never compounds.</li></ul><p>Ironically, proximity to a problem often <em>lowers</em> the actual complexity but <em>lowers</em> perceived legitimacy—an information asymmetry at the heart of systemic inequity.</p><h3 id="42-complexity-compression-artifacts">4.2 Complexity Compression Artifacts</h3><p>Social media highlight-reels flatten five-year treks into 30-second montages, creating <strong>false complexity maps</strong>.

Reduce verification cost (via trust, cryptographic proofs, or social coherence) and the <strong>effective speed of change</strong> increases.
