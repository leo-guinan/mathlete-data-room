DIAGNOSE YOUR FRAGMENT (30 minutes)</h3><p><strong>What's a Fragment?</strong></p><p>It's the specific way you sabotage yourself when facing complexity.</p><p>There are 7 types:</p><ul><li><strong>Whale:</strong> Chasing past glory instead of building new</li><li><strong>Researcher:</strong> Gathering data instead of taking action</li><li><strong>Builder:</strong> Coding alone instead of talking to humans</li><li><strong>Speculator:</strong> Planning the future instead of shipping now</li><li><strong>Validator:</strong> Waiting for permission instead of deciding</li><li><strong>Activist:</strong> Pivoting constantly instead of committing</li><li><strong>Crystallized:</strong> Defending old patterns instead of evolving</li></ul><p><strong>Most founders are blind to their Fragment.</strong></p><p>It activates during stress. It feels like "being strategic" or "doing due diligence."</p><p>But it's actually the thing preventing your progress.</p><p><strong>In 30 minutes, I'll identify yours.</strong></p><p>And once you see it, you can't unsee it.</p><hr><h3 id="2-audit-your-time-violence-30-minutes">2. AUDIT YOUR TIME VIOLENCE (30 minutes)</h3><p><strong>What's Time Violence?</strong></p><p>The systematic theft of your time through unnecessary complexity.</p><p>It's the gap between how long something SHOULD take and how long it ACTUALLY takes.</p><p>When that gap exceeds 10x, it's violence.</p><p><strong>Here's what we'll calculate:</strong></p><p><strong>Your Project's Time Violence Score:</strong></p><ul><li>How many hours have you spent?</li><li>How many of those hours were productive?</li><li>What's the complexity multiplier? (How much harder than it needs to be)</li><li>What's your opportunity cost? (What else could you have built)</li></ul><p><strong>Example calculation:</strong></p><pre><code>150 hours over 6 months
× 3x complexity (it shouldn't be this hard)
× $75/hour opportunity cost
= $33,750 in wasted potential
</code></pre><p><strong>That number will hurt.</strong></p><p>Good. Pain is clarity trying to break through.</p><hr><h3 id="3-build-your-90-day-roadmap-30-minutes">3. BUILD YOUR 90-DAY ROADMAP (30 minutes)</h3><p>Now that you know:</p><ul><li><strong>Your Fragment</strong> (what sabotages you)</li><li><strong>Your Time Violence</strong> (what you're wasting)</li></ul><p>We build your path forward.</p><p><strong>Your custom roadmap includes:</strong></p><p><strong>Week 1-4: Pattern Recognition Training</strong></p><ul><li>Daily exercises to see your Fragment activating</li><li>Time Violence tracking for current projects</li><li>Decision journal to catch yourself mid-sabotage</li></ul><p><strong>Week 5-8: Complexity Survival Documentation</strong></p><ul><li>Identify ONE system you've survived that breaks others</li><li>Document every step (this becomes your expertise)</li><li>Test it with one person drowning in that complexity</li></ul><p><strong>Week 9-12: Navigator Model Design</strong></p><ul><li>Turn your survival into a service</li><li>Price your expertise correctly</li><li>Make your first sale</li></ul><p><strong>By Day 90:</strong></p><ul><li>You'll see patterns you were blind to before</li><li>You'll have documented expertise worth money</li><li>You'll have a clear path to Journeyman (Git Gud → Git Paid)</li></ul><hr><h2 id="what-else-you-get">WHAT ELSE YOU GET</h2><h3 id="7-days-of-direct-access">7 Days of Direct Access</h3><p>After the session, you get <strong>7 days of Slack access</strong>.</p><p>Stuck on an assignment?

Message me.</p><p><strong>Response time: Within 24 hours</strong></p><hr><h3 id="custom-ai-prompt-pack">Custom AI Prompt Pack</h3><p>Your Fragment has specific patterns.</p><p>I'll build you <strong>5 custom GPT prompts</strong> tailored to YOUR dysfunction:</p><p><strong>For Researchers:</strong></p><ul><li>"Stop me when I'm gathering data instead of taking action"</li><li>"Is this research necessary or am I procrastinating?"</li></ul><p><strong>For Builders:</strong></p><ul><li>"Remind me to talk to customers before coding this"</li><li>"Is this feature solving a real problem or just interesting to me?"</li></ul><p><strong>For Speculators:</strong></p><ul><li>"Bring me back to 2025. What can I ship this week?"</li><li>"Is this plan actionable now or am I future-tripping?"</li></ul><p><em>Etc. for all 7 Fragments.</em></p><p>These prompts become your <strong>external pattern recognition system</strong>.</p><p>Use them daily. They'll save you from yourself.</p><hr><h3 id="day-7-accountability-check-in">Day 7 Accountability Check-In</h3><p>At the end of 7 days, we have a <strong>15-minute check-in call</strong>.</p><p>You'll report:</p><ul><li>What patterns you noticed</li><li>What got in your way</li><li>Whether you completed the Week 1 assignments</li></ul><p><strong>This isn't optional.</strong></p><p>If you bought this and didn't use it, I want to know why.</p><p>Because the only thing worse than wasting money is wasting potential.</p><hr><h2 id="who-is-this-for">WHO IS THIS FOR?</h2><h3 id="%E2%9C%85-this-is-for-you-if">✅ This is for you if:</h3><ul><li>You've been "working on your idea" for 3+ months without shipping</li><li>You keep starting projects but never finishing them</li><li>You suspect you're sabotaging yourself but can't see how</li><li>You've read about Time Violence and want to apply it to YOUR situation</li><li>You value speed over cost</li><li>You're willing to hear hard truths</li></ul><h3 id="%E2%9D%8C-this-is-not-for-you-if">❌ This is NOT for you if:</h3><ul><li>You want someone to tell you your idea is great (it's probably not)</li><li>You're not willing to calculate how much time you've wasted (too painful)</li><li>You expect me to sugarcoat feedback (I won't)</li><li>You think one session will "fix everything" (it won't—it'll show you what to fix)</li><li>You're not prepared to do the work after the session</li></ul><p><strong>Be honest with yourself.</strong></p><p>This session is a mirror.

Leo diagnosed my Fragment in 20 minutes. I'm a classic Researcher. Now I see it activating before I waste the day. </em>Saved me at least $5K in wasted time.<em>"</em><br><strong>— Sarah, Healthcare Navigator</strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>"I've been 'working on my idea' for 8 months with nothing to show. 90 minutes with Leo and I finally understood WHY. The Time Violence audit was brutal but necessary. </em>Now I have a roadmap that actually makes sense. Shipped my MVP 2 weeks later.<em>"</em><br><strong>— Justin, Education Navigator</strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>"$297 felt steep until I calculated my Time Violence Score: $41,000 wasted. Suddenly $297 for pattern recognition seemed cheap. Got my Fragment diagnosed, my roadmap built, and 7 days of access. Already changed how I work. </em>Caught myself going into Speculator mode yesterday and stopped.<em>"</em><br><strong>— Adam, Leadership Navigator</strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id="the-investment">THE INVESTMENT</h2><p><strong>$297</strong></p><p>That's:</p><ul><li>90 minutes of pattern recognition</li><li>7 days of direct access</li><li>Custom AI prompt pack</li><li>15-minute accountability check-in</li><li>A roadmap that saves you 3 months</li></ul><p><strong>Compare that to:</strong></p><ul><li>The $5,000+ you'll waste building the wrong thing</li><li>The 3 months you'll lose spinning in analysis paralysis</li><li>The opportunity cost of NOT shipping when you could've</li></ul><p><strong>$297 is cheap insurance against your own dysfunction.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="the-upgrade-path">THE UPGRADE PATH</h2><p>Here's the deal:</p><p>If you do this session and realize you need MORE support, you can <strong>apply the $297 as a deposit</strong> toward the <strong>Navigator Intensive</strong> (normally $3,000).</p><p><strong>That means:</strong></p><ul><li>Do the Accelerator for $297</li><li>Decide if you want the full Intensive</li><li>If yes, you only pay $2,703 more</li></ul><p><strong>Worst case:</strong> You spend $297 and get 90 minutes of clarity that saves you months.</p><p><strong>Best case:</strong> You spend $297, realize you need the full program, and it becomes your deposit.</p><p><strong>Either way, you win.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I just book the full Navigator Intensive instead?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. But most people don't know if they need that level of support until AFTER they see their patterns clearly. The Accelerator is the test drive.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I don't finish the assignments in 7 days?</strong></p><p>A: Then you prove you're not ready for the full program. And that's valuable data. Better to learn that for $297 than $3,000.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this a sales call for the Intensive?</strong></p><p>A: No. This is a real session with real value. I don't pitch during the 90 minutes. If you want the Intensive after, YOU bring it up.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I don't like what you tell me?</strong></p><p>A: Then you're probably not ready to hear it. Which is also valuable data. No refunds for hurt feelings.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I record the session?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. You'll want to. You'll hear things that don't land until Day 3 or Day 14 or Day 47.</p><p><strong>Q: What if my Fragment is "none of these"?</strong></p><p>A: It's not. You just haven't seen yourself clearly yet. That's what the session is for.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need to be in the Bottega to book this?</strong></p><p>A: No. But Bottega members get priority booking. And if you're NOT in the Bottega, you should be.</p><hr><h2 id="what-happens-next">WHAT HAPPENS NEXT</h2><ol><li><strong>Click the button below</strong> to book your session</li><li><strong>Fill out the pre-session form</strong> (10 minutes—helps me prepare)</li><li><strong>Join the 90-minute Zoom call</strong> at your scheduled time</li><li><strong>Get your roadmap + prompts</strong> immediately after</li><li><strong>Use your 7 days of access</strong> to ask questions</li><li><strong>Complete Day 7 check-in</strong> to report progress</li></ol><p><strong>Available slots:</strong> 8 per month<br><strong>Current availability:</strong> </p>
