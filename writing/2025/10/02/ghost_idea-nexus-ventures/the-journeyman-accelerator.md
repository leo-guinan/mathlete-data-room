One session with Jorge and I saw I was leaving $1,500 on the table per client. Switched to outcome pricing at $1,200 per case. Made $7,200 my first month. The session paid for itself 14x over."</em><br><strong>— Marcus, Disability Benefits Navigator</strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>"I'd helped 23 people navigate insurance appeals for free. Jorge did the math: I'd given away $87,000 in value. We built a tiered pricing model ($400/$1,200/$2,500). First client paid $1,200. Second paid $2,500. I made $3,700 in two weeks after years of helping people for nothing."</em><br><strong>— Sarah, Healthcare Appeals Navigator</strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>"I thought I needed a course, a website, a funnel. Jorge said: 'You need three clients at $2,000 each.' He was right. I had a client within 5 days of our session. The business model blueprint showed me exactly what to say, how to price, what to offer. Saved me 6 months of building the wrong thing."</em><br><strong>— David, Tax Strategy Navigator</strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>"The Navigator Value calculation broke something in my brain. I was giving away 40 hours of my time to save people $4,000. Jorge showed me that was $4,000 of value for $0 compensation. Now I charge $1,200 per case (30% of value created). Booked solid for 8 weeks. $497 for the diagnostic. $14,400 in revenue from what I learned.

But most people don't know if they need that level of support until AFTER they see their business model clearly. The Diagnostic is the test drive.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I don't make any sales in 7 days?</strong></p><p>A: Then we figure out why in the check-in. Could be pricing, positioning, or client acquisition. That's valuable data worth way more than $497.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this a sales call for the Intensive?</strong></p><p>A: No. This is a real session with real value. I don't pitch during the 90 minutes. If you want the Intensive after, YOU bring it up.</p><p><strong>Q: I'm already making money. Do I need this?</strong></p><p>A: Are you making what you COULD be making? Most navigators underprice by 50-70%. If you're charging $500 when you could charge $2,000, you need this.</p><p><strong>Q: What if my complexity is too niche?</strong></p><p>A: There's no such thing. If ONE person needs help navigating it, 100 people do. Niche is good. Niche is pricing power.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I record the session?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. You'll want to. The revenue model won't make sense until Day 14 when you're actually trying to price something.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need to be in the Bottega 1010 to book this?</strong></p><p>A: No. But Bottega members get priority booking and pay only $397 (Journeyman Guild perk).</p><hr><h2 id="what-happens-next">WHAT HAPPENS NEXT</h2><ol><li><strong>Click the button below</strong> to book your session</li><li><strong>Fill out the pre-session form</strong> (15 minutes—helps me understand your pattern)</li><li><strong>Join the 90-minute Zoom call</strong> at your scheduled time</li><li><strong>Get your Business Model Blueprint</strong> within 24 hours</li><li><strong>Use your 7 days of Voxer access</strong> to ask questions</li><li><strong>Complete Day 7 check-in</strong> to report progress</li></ol><p><strong>Available slots:</strong> 6 per month<br><strong>Current availability:</strong> [Display live calendar]</p><hr><h2 id="the-bottom-line">THE BOTTOM LINE</h2><p>You have two choices:</p><p><strong>Choice 1:</strong> Keep underpricing your expertise.<br>Keep charging $50/hour when you should charge $2,000.<br>Keep "helping people" while going broke.<br>Keep telling yourself "money isn't why I do this" while drowning in bills.</p><p><strong>Choice 2:</strong> Spend 90 minutes seeing your value clearly.<br>Get your survival pattern documented.<br>Calculate what you're actually worth.<br>Build a revenue model that doesn't exploit you.</p><p><strong>$497.
