title: Understanding your place in the bottega
---

<p>The beautiful thing about the bottega is that there is a clear hierarchy. The master of the bottega is at the top, because they understand why things are the way they are. They see patterns that others in the bottega cannot.</p><p>In the digital world, we are each the master of our own bottega. I wrote a book earlier in the year about being your own personal enterprise. And published it on Amazon without any marketing because I was curious about the process. But that was before I understood what the bottega was and how it worked.</p><p>In the bottega, the master's time is the most valuable. This means that there is a clear ownership over your own time. When I saw the pattern for Time Violence, I realized I was my own worst perpetrator because I couldn't value my own time correctly.</p><p>And I realized exactly why that was.</p><p>There's not a clear journeyman layer anymore. In the bottega, the job of the master is to teach the journeyman how they use their skills in the market. They show them  what's valuable so that they can eventually leave and start their own bottegas.</p><p>In my jobs, everyone had no problem telling me what to do. And giving me a set amount of money. But nobody taught me exactly how to sell my skills specifically. I had to learn things the hard way.</p>
