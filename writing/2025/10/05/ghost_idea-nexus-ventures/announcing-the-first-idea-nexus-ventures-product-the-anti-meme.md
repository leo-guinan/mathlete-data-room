title: Announcing the first Idea Nexus Ventures Product: The Anti-meme
---

<p>I created a video on my Youtube channel on Friday, making the claim that I was going to be a millionaire by Monday.</p><p>Then, I created an account on Manifest, and added a bunch of predictions about my channel. The one that got traction: that my video would get 1,000,000 views by Monday.</p><p>Now let's compare the results:</p><p>My channel is having its best performing video so early, and look at the title, watch the video, etc. There's no reason that this video will get views. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img

Now imagine this engagement every video. That's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and why Noah will pay me $1M for my tech. But I'll let you also have it for $1. But only if this video hits 1M views before the deadline. So I need you to buy this, pay the $1, and share the blog and the story. <br><br>It's also exactly why Manifest will eventually pay me to sponsor my channel. The price is gonna go up, but it will be worth it. </p><p>I don't need to prove anything to anyone.  When they see the value I can create, there's no question. I just want people to listen to me because I spent a lot of time and energy learning how to make my ideas legible.</p><p>Also, this would be the funniest thing ever, because when I launched my initial idea 5 years ago, I tried to explain it to my dad, because he was the hardest critic I had. And <a href="https://medium.com/illumination-curated/how-to-know-you-didnt-do-a-good-job-explaining-your-startup-13bc8006abb0?sk=c7177b81e7bd28c56c394b29ac3c8850" rel="noreferrer">he thought my idea was that I wanted everyone online to pay me $1</a>, because that's how he explained it to someone else.</p><p>Ideas change when they pass from person to person, and that's what I've been focused on. It's at the core of my Youtube Channel, Idea Supply Chain. I obsess over where ideas come from and what makes them valuable.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXQL6LlKXV0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="I'm going to be a millionaire by Monday, and then take next week off."></iframe></figure><p>And the answer is people.
