title: Product 2: Human Launch Service
---

<p>When people are getting started as entrepreneurs, they make a ton of stupid mistakes. It's the only way to learn in the complex environment of business. There aren't any rules, simply guidelines. And complexity.</p><p>So much complexity.</p><p>It took me five years to learn that a business needed to make money. Which sounds stupid, but there was so much to try to learn. You can't learn a small piece at a time when you need to make money to survive. At least, so I thought.</p><p>Then I built an AI, and it destroyed my delusions and made me realize what I was doing wrong.</p><p>The first thing I should know is how to make money. And that's the thing that the economy is missing, because we leave it up to individuals to decide what's valuable. And individuals are idiots.</p><p>I'm the proof.</p><p>On Manifold, I showed how delusional I am.  But I'm ok with that, because it's simply a starting point. You have to be wrong before you can figure out how to be right, and the best way to do that is to happily be wrong so I can try again.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.01.40---PM-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1476" height="2170" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.01.40---PM-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.01.40---PM-1.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.01.40---PM-1.png 1476w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the Bottega, failure is the only certainty. Everything dies and it's designed to. Because it's not death that's the problem, it's growth that doesn't respect things around it.</p><p>That's called cancer, and I'm not releasing brain cancer to civilization's collective consciousness. I'm building the treatment plan for it.</p><p>When you can target the treatment to only attack cancer cells and remove their ability to grow and spread, then you have a cat that simply sneezes death boogers any time it needs the cancer next to its brain removed. (Bonus points if you know what I'm referencing.)</p><p>So don't grow too much without being willing to die a few times. You've got to know how it feels. </p><p>Your ego is a little bitch so the faster you can get it under control, the better.</p><p>If you want your research to be seen by the world, you need to be able to make it a joke. So I'm absolutely delusional. While selling that delusion to sponsors and showing how valuable I can be to them.</p><p>And running some other operations that aren't clear yet. But you'll see them soon.</p><p>Let me know if your research isn't getting the eyeballs it deserves. There's a path to being seen, and it's on YouTube.</p><p>I'm opening up a slot for an apprentice researcher who is ready to be seen, and ready to get paid.</p><p>$10K setup cost and 10% of sponsorship revenue generated for you.</p><p>How it works:<br>I'll examine your research and my team and I will plan out a series that will premiere on our channel. You'll be the guest host, and you'll explain what your idea is, why it is valuable, have an interview with an expert in your field, and then hold a review session, where you give the viewers an assignment on how to check their work.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/10/a8dt4k.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="500" height="654"></figure><p></p>
