<p>Your name has been added to the apprentice ledger.<br>The first letter is already being prepared — it will arrive soon.</p><p>The Bottega doesn’t rush.<br>Mastery doesn’t move at the speed of algorithms.<br>It moves at the pace of attention.</p><p>Over the next days, you’ll receive five letters.<br>Each one will challenge how you think about time, leverage, and creation.<br>Each one is a step deeper into the workshop.</p><p>Until then, do nothing.<br>Just <em>watch yourself.</em><br>Notice where your time goes.<br>Notice what steals your focus.<br>Notice what deserves it.</p><p>That’s the first assignment.</p><p>When the first letter arrives, open it with care.<br>Read it slowly.<br>You’re no longer a follower. </p><p>You’re an apprentice.</p><hr><blockquote>
<p>🕯️ “All mastery begins in silence.”</p>
