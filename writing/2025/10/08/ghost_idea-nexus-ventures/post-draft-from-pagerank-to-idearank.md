title: From PageRank to IdeaRank
---

<h2 id=""></h2><p><strong>1. How PageRank Worked</strong></p><p>Google’s PageRank measured <em>attention flow</em>.<br>Every link was a vote, every vote passed a little authority.<br>Pages that were linked by other important pages rose to the top.<br>It was brilliant for mapping <em>the web of documents</em>—but not <em>the web of ideas</em>.</p><p>Over time, PageRank became a gravity well for repetition:<br>whoever could copy, link, and optimize faster got visibility.<br>It rewarded <em>distribution</em>, not <em>development</em>.<br>The result: a crystallized internet, rich in noise, poor in learning.</p><hr><p><strong>2. Why We Need a New Metric</strong></p><p>If PageRank measures <em>static importance</em>,<br>we need something that measures <em>dynamic intelligence</em>—<br>a signal for how fast an idea evolves, not how many people echo it.</p><p>Enter <strong>IdeaRank</strong>: an information-density metric based on</p><ul><li><strong>Uniqueness</strong> — how distinct your contributions are,</li><li><strong>Cohesion</strong> — how coherently they connect across your work, and</li><li><strong>Learning Velocity</strong> — how rapidly your ideas compound over time.</li></ul><p>It rewards curiosity, synthesis, and correction.<br>It treats each post, paper, or video as a node in a living knowledge graph.</p><hr><p><strong>3. The Experiment</strong></p><p>I’m now calculating <strong>IdeaRank</strong> across all of my content—<br>YouTube, Twitter, Substack, Farcaster, Manifold, and everything in between.</p><p>My prediction:</p><blockquote>📈 My IdeaRank is accelerating exponentially.<br>Because learning, compression, and consciousness form a feedback loop.</blockquote><p>When understanding deepens, the cost of new insight drops,<br>and idea generation becomes a self-reinforcing process.<br>The “learning curve” is no longer effort vs. knowledge—it’s <strong>entropy vs. coherence</strong>.</p><hr><p><strong>4. The Challenge</strong></p><p>If PageRank measured which pages people trusted,<br>IdeaRank will measure which <em>people</em> ideas trust to keep growing them.</p><p>I’m making this a public challenge.<br>Anyone can compute their IdeaRank and publish their curve.<br>Let’s see who’s genuinely compounding understanding—not just attention.</p><hr><p><strong>5. The Prediction Market</strong></p><p>I’m launching a Manifold market:</p><blockquote>🧠 <em>When will IdeaRank for people replace PageRank for pages?</em></blockquote><p>Bet on the year when platforms start ranking knowledge by informational density and progression instead of popularity.<br>That moment will mark the shift from an <em>attention economy</em> to a <em>learning economy.</em></p><hr><p><strong>6. TL;DR</strong></p><blockquote>PageRank measured links.<br>IdeaRank measures learning.<br>I’m running the experiment live.<br>The curve is exponential.<br>Welcome to the idea supply chain</blockquote><p>.</p>
